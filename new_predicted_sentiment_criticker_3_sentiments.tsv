	Movie	Review	Predicted
0	Groundhog Day	You will not be permitted to continue your life until you fuck Andie MacDowell.  THE GODS DEMAND THAT YOU GET INSIDE ANDIE MACDOWELL'S PANTS.	2
1	Pulp Fiction	(after repeat viewings) Among my favourite screenplays of all time: the non linear structure makes for a deliciously madcap viewing experience, in which Tarantino weaves together threads of mirthful mayhem, disarming sweetness and genuine hilarity into an amazingly coherent whole. There aren't enough thumbs in the world to do Pulp Fiction half the justice it deserves, I just love this film!	2
2	Apocalypse Now	My favorite film, a surreal, haunting, visually flamboyant masterpiece. It's one awe-inspiring sequence after another, from the Ride of the Valkyries bombing to the incredibly nightmarish encounter at the Do Luong bridge. (Who's your commanding officer? Ain't you?) Few other epics so freely embrace their own insanity, and it works to brilliant effect. Some movies transcend their genres; this one transcends its medium. This is the end...	2
3	Lost in Translation	I love it.  It's just nice to look at all the beautiful scenery, very dreamy.  I can always pop this in if I'm having a bad day and feel infinitely better.  Also, the soundtrack is perfect and Kevin Shields should be forced to work on more films.  Bill Murray is always immensely watchable and it's no different here.  One of my favorites.	2
4	Let the Right One In	Truly original. Perfectly balanced. The mix of vampire-horror with a coming-of-age story of a bullied boy proves very potent because supernatural happenings to Oskar seem not that much more violent and weird than the everyday life of growing up. The kids are as great as the cinematography is brilliant. A wonderful surprise and the best film of 2008.	2
5	Jack	Francis Ford Coppola's masterful followup to The Godfather saga.	2
6	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	This movie is the true reason for Arnold Schwarzenegger's fame. He plays the role of the Terminator to perfection and Robert Patrick's distinct haunting presence is brilliant. The visuals are, even now, quite impressive. The dialog and story are both excellent. Indeed, this is one of the best action films you'll ever see and arguably James Cameron's best film.	2
7	Jurassic World	..and as you can see the head accountant continues, adding the Poochiesaurus Rex boosts expected revenue to ridiculous heights. The Omni Consumer Products execs applaud. Once we realised we could simply copy the original product and replace its 'suspense' and 'sense of wonder' with our InsultinglyContrivedBullshit formula, we got results! We present to you... Jurassic World!. A reanimated dinosaur corpse shuffles into the room. It opens its crooked, drooling maw. Money falls out. Applause.	0
8	Chinatown	Polanski does a wonderful job, the cast does a wonderful job, but Robert Towne's script steals the show. After a thousand little pieces fall right into place at the very last scene, the sheer perfection of this story hits you, hard.	2
9	Alice in Wonderland	In his most strident political commentary since Planet of the Apes, Burton shows the folly of the current American Two Party system, and the malaise caused by the healthcare lobby through the Red Queen's associates. In quite an intertextual populist jibe, he mocks the jobless economic recovery by employing over 200 CGI animators to create even less character and life than 30 dudes with pencils in the 1950's.	2
10	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	A magnificent black comedy. Peter Sellers does a great job with all his characters and even 40 years later much of the film's biting satire still feels relevant.	2
11	Pan's Labyrinth	I love a good film about imagination and private fantasy worlds, and Pan's Labyrinth had me spellbound from beginning to end. Even though the template for the story is a fairy tale, the film has layers of complexity to it. The story is helped along immensely by wonderful art direction and special effects for the more fantastical elements, and perfect acting for the more earthbound parts. Fantastic stuff.	2
12	Elysium	Proper health care is science fiction to Americans.	2
13	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Not just canny commentary on how this generation's experiences are inextricably mediated through the prism of pop culture; it captures an attendant myopia, too. Any coincidence the film parallels Scott's fundamental narcissism w/ the endless parade of exclusionary inside jokes? Or that Scott (and by extension the audience) finds it impossible to separate his culture-saturated inner world from the world at large? It's all exhilaratingly, uninhibitedly hyperreal: Baudrillard would have a field day	0
14	2001: A Space Odyssey	The greatest American film of the 1960s, and probably the pinnacle of cinematic expression thus far achieved. A unique film, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a reflection on the correspondence of anthropogenesis and technogenesis, and on the fate of this common origin. Note to first-time viewers: the first viewing of this film must be nowhere else than in a well-equipped large-screen cinema with high-quality sound. A singular achievement.	1
15	A Clockwork Orange	Brilliant, savagely cynical, perceptive, funny, perpetually relevant - this movie, for me, perfectly demonstrates the power of the film medium at its highest potential. The comments on virtue, free will, redemption, religion, government, radicalism, and the human spirit are accurately and beautifully expressed through McDowell's sublime performance and Kubrick's impeccable and meticulous direction.   	2
16	Alice in Wonderland	Tim, I think we need to talk. I want us to start seeing other films. This just isn't working for me, and I've been feeling this way for a long time. I've told you time and time again to plant the red roses, yet you keep planting the white ones and I refuse to keep up this nonsensical painting business. I guess this is goodbye. PS: Stephen, call me later. ;) 	0
17	Inglourious Basterds	Basterds has some truly jaw dropping, laugh out loud and cringe worthy moments that you won't soon forget. Over time this will become a classic that will made example of for the right reasons. Christoph Waltz particularly shines in one of the most awe inspiring casts who together produce some of the best lines you will hear in film. Fluently blends genres to create the ultimate extravaganza.	2
18	Angels & Demons	This film is based on the ungood book by Dan Brown. As the book is written in a style that is not good I thought I would write my review about this bad film & its badness in the same style Mr Brown does his books when he writes his books. In short the silly film is not a good film, as the silly film is boring and dull and is not a good film. Even a competent director as Ron Howard can't make the silly film unsilly, as its based on the poorly written book which resulted in the film being ungood.	0
19	2001: A Space Odyssey	My favorite film, impossible to overstate the pedestal from which it radiates. A monument reverberating through science fiction, special effects technology, the art of cinema. The most spellbinding audiovisual work of the mid-century; brain-itching allegory conveyed with spine-tingling aesthetic sensations.  Scientific plausibility and human ingenuity cannot contain this far out imagination, expressionist and surreal, an ambiguous spiritualism, cosmic wonder at all things beyond mortal capacity.	1
20	Beginners	The impossible task of trying to love and live, while dealing with an existential grief is handled expertly in Beginners. It's a real rarity: A movie that feels genuine. Strip away the interactions, the small shifts in facial expressions and all the things unsaid, and you're left with a very ordinary movie. Fortunately these things can't be stripped away. They're part of the movie's flesh and blood. They're the very fabric of life. Beginners is pain and catharsis rolled into one.	0
21	Ted	The joke distribution is about 50% Haha, I get that reference, 20% fart jokes, 10% racism, 5% gross out humor, 3% slapstick, 2% gay jokes, and about 10% that I actually found funny. All of which, unlike on Family Guy, are woven into a coherent plot, albeit a predictable and completely formulaic one. This comedy sometimes works, but the humor and plot are just lazy, and that prevents this from ever being anything more than mediocre.	1
22	Leprechaun 4: In Space	Not since _Citizen Kane_ has there ever been... just kidding.	1
23	Big Hero 6	This is a great movie if you've never seen a movie before.	2
24	The Hunger Games	This is where I mention that It's no Battle Royale and then all the beautiful women in the world flock to me because I have shown them how cool and smart I am by having seen/read a more obscure movie/book that this borrowed heavily from. I will await these women in my bedding chambers.	0
25	Fifty Shades of Grey	"So no means yes? I asked. 

Yes, he said. 

Does that mean no? I asked. 

No, he replied. 

So, yes? I asked again. 

No. 

Yes? 

Yes, but no. What I mean is yes-yes. 

To no-yes or yes-no? 

I had a lot to learn about sex."	1
26	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	During the entire three hour duration I was riveted, this movie has so many compelling and beautiful settings that when combined with the fine screenwriting/acting/directing/music it is no doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen.	2
27	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	What can anyone really say about this film at this point? It shaped the imaginations of a billion children , and to this day remains relevant and is spawning spin offs. Just goes to show you not every script has to be as detailed as Inception to be a great movie experience. 	0
28	There Will Be Blood	I can't describe how good it is. There Will Be Blood is a classic from start to finish. This will go down in history as one of the most crushing, and powerful movies ever to hit the cinema. Amazing plotline and brilliant direction along with incredible acting from Day-Lewis and the rest of the cast. Has several memorable scenes too that puts chills down my spine. Just a masterpiece.	2
29	Blade Runner	Blade Runner is more than Ridley, Vangelis, P.K. Dick, more than it's crew or material used in the work. From childhood the first time I saw the movie it's effect still dwells in my mind. The scenery is more melancholic than fourties America, or seventies France where hardboiled noir has it's own space. For me no special effect surpassed the beauty of Blade Running. Like a visual track for the lost causes. (ok managed to sound not like a scifi nerd, oh no movie geek is still at large)	1
30	Oblivion	Sally draws inspiration from 2001, the mechanic (Wall-e) brings a flower to his girl (Eva) and mantains a house of Earth souvenirs -- just like the Pixar film --, the human beings that still live here wear Predator-like masks and inhabit a location that seemed to be borrowed from Matrix. And the music is from Tron. And other references go from Moon to Independence Day. This drone-oriented, what-you-believe-about-everything-is-a-lie, me-and-my-clones sci-fi should just be called Copie Conforme.	0
31	Twilight	I nearly died of ennui. Boring, vaguely sexist crap for fat girls and morons. Here is a list of things that are terrible: the writing, the direction, the special effects, the cinematography, the bulk of the acting, the premise, etc. Fuck you, movie. 	0
32	Argo	This film is just like Ben Affleck himself, it possesses a well put together vanilla exterior, says the right things, and does an adequate storytelling job but is still missing something. There's just not enough of a cerebral introspective look at the incident. Affleck successfully adapts straight forward character interaction and footage but gives us nothing new that a documentary wouldn't have done better. It is a well shot and acted piece with entertaining moments but light and too Hollywood.	0
33	Taxi Driver	De Niro is insane in his role as Travis Bickle, but he's not the only brilliant character in this film: 1970s New York City comes to life as a dirty, crime-infested world of extremes, a world that drives Bickle to the actions he commits, all thanks to Scorsese's brilliant direction. Few other films come close to the slowly growing insanity that this film provides, seemingly without effort, as it lets these two insane characters bounce off each other and grow.	2
34	2001: A Space Odyssey	Perfect cinematography, score, acting, editing, directing, screenplay, story. If I was on an island and I could only pick 1 movie, this would be it.	2
35	A Clockwork Orange	A Clockwork Orange is easily one of the greatest, and yet strangest and controversial films of all time. When you sit down and watch this film, you will have a large variety of emotions going through you. You'll watch this film and be disturbed about what you see, and yet you can't help but laugh at some of the things they say. It's truly a unique experience. Kubrick paints a perfect portrait of the future, filled with memorable scenes and a great score. Unique and Different. 	2
36	Guardians of the Galaxy	Okay, this movie was pretty awesome! What makes Guardians of the Galaxy worth watching is the not only the writing, but also it's visuals, cool characters, good sense of humor, music, and the true spirit it has for adventure. It's not afraid to take risks but it is definitely one of the strongest movies I've seen from Marvel and it's full characters who (almost) all stand out. I left the theater very happy and excited for the next MCU film. I can't wait to see more of these characters!	2
37	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	I love it, and the hate is unfounded. It feels like a comic book, whereas Nolan did not (and stop comparing the two! They're entirely different). The action was crunchy and intense, the music was wonderful outside of one misguided track and placement, Ben did great and so did Galdot. I understood everything that went on so I don't know where it's incoherent, and I think it has more depth than it's given credit for, but ultimately style over substance isn't actually a bad thing.	0
38	The Passion of the Christ	Felt like I was there, and as a non-practicing, hook-nosed dirty jew, I appreciated the opportunity to kill your lord a second time.	2
39	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey	Where is all the fucking drama? If I wanted to spend three hours with mindless slow-mo action and half-assed one-liners I would have watched some Michael Bay movie. Granted, Hobbit is an eye candy, but that's the only aspect where it shines.  Jackson isn't the same young ambitious director who made LOTR. Too much safe bets makes Hobbit a bland blockbuster, like so many others.	0
40	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	The blackest of comedies, it pokes fun at the terrifying ludicrousness of nuclear warfare; the world set to burn with petty rivalries, hurt feelings and bureaucracy providing the tinder. Kubrick conforms to no comedic conventions with wonderfully awkward silences, starkly realistic sets and deadly serious subject matter all contrasting sharply with the inherent absurdities. Favourite scenes are between Mandrake and Ripper, but Turgidson is also hilarious. The quintessential comedy as catharsis.	2
41	Conan the Barbarian	Ever see a man punch a camel?	1
42	Star Trek	I think Abrams did a fantastic job of converting a tired yet seminal television series into a movie that people actually want to see. Well acted, well paced, and very satisfying. Just don't come expecting a depth beyond the glaze of cool, it remains a product of its nature and further commercialization. I really enjoyed the well orchestrated action sequences and the references that I got, but Star Trek does not transcend its genre, it merely exemplifies it.	2
43	Die Hard	Willis and Rickman are the perfect hero-villain matchup in the perfect action movie. Every single plot execution - apart from how the Feds are so brazenly stupid, but that's part of the charm - and every character, even the one-offs (Hans... Bubi!) works seamlessly. The fact that the dead terrorist's shoes don't fit him speaks volumes to McClane's enduring appeal as the hero that bleeds. Also one of the very few 80's movies that is simultaneously of its time and timeless.	2
44	Mad Max: Fury Road	In this post-apocalyptic wasteland we call The Action Genre anno 2015, an unlikely savior emerges; a 70 year old Australian with a love for talking farm animals and dancing penguins, returns to the world he once created, and shows everyone how this shit is done. An unapologetically baroque, meticulously executed, operatic action masterpiece. What a lovely day indeed!  	2
45	Starship Troopers	This is where it's at. Tits and blood and guns. Starship Troopers is unapologetically a big, dumb action flick. The story is straight 1950's B-horror, and the script and acting are terrible. But, there is TONS of boobs and gore and giant bugs that blow up real good. Oh, and a fat alien slug with a face like a vagina.	0
46	Prometheus	A movie industry professional once told me that some bad movies have great scripts, but it's never the other way around. 'Prometheus' comes awfully close to being an exception to the latter. The first two acts are impressively handled, but in the end Sir Scott's visual flair is defeated by a script from the 'Cowboys and Aliens' dude. Instead of horror it reaches for hard sci-fi, but leaves only simple questions like: Huh? Why was anyone doing what they were doing? And what did it matter, anyway?	1
47	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	It was about 20 min. into this Disney-licensed toy ad, that I came to the sad realization that Star Wars is no longer a series made for me. In some sterile board room in SoCal, it was decided by a murder of pressed Armanis that Star Wars should no longer be something that *some people loved*, but something that *everyone liked*, and in doing so, they sucked all the magic out of it, choosing to embrace demographic metadata in a corporate cash-grab rather than the hearts of those who remember '77.	1
48	Jurassic World	JW was brought to you by: Beats Audio, Samsung, Starbucks, Brookstone, Viewmaster, Verizon Wireless, Pepsi, Tostitos, Hasbro, Mercedes, Coca Cola, Nikon, Triumph, NBC/Jimmy Fallon, IWC, Ben and Jerry's, IMAX, Jamba Juice, Margaritaville, Hilton, and Pandora. Don't worry though, there are enough shreds of a story in there to keep this 'Logorama' of a film moving along, but not fast enough for you to miss all the plot conveniences and buffoonery packed into each scene. What a wasteful cash-grab.	0
49	Whiplash	Full Music Jacket	1
50	Guardians of the Galaxy	Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel film to-date. It has great action -- CGI overloaded or not -- it's absolutely hilarious, and despite its weird but interesting cast of characters, you'll care about them and their fates by the point when things begin to get serious. It's different from previous Marvel outings, and that's a good thing. It has a great cast, a light plot -- that keeps things moving and little else -- and is one of the most enjoyable times I've had watching a movie.	2
51	Teaching Mrs. Tingle	Let me get this straight; 3 students invade a teacher's home, beat her unconscious, tie her to a bed, and at one point, sexually assault her....and she's the villain and they're good?  Seriously?  	2
52	Before Sunrise	A rare thing: a movie that shows you exactly how & why two characters fall in love. Other romances - even some of the good ones - do a montage to music with snippets of the couple walking, laughing, eating, & (at worst) taking pictures in a photo booth. But you never know exactly why they're laughing or what they're saying. This movie is all about the things those movies leave out. Just the conversations (!) between 2 fully developed characters, not stereotypes. So good it all seems real.  	0
53	Alien	The tone of this film is immaculate.  It is dirty, grimy, industrial-looking, but, most importantly, it is lonely.  The alien is terrifying enough, but Scott, oh so subtly, gives the notion that these people are completely alone and nowhere near any help.  The echos and shadows make the ship like nothing I have seen before in film.  A true leader in the genre.	1
54	Inception	Inception is not a lot of things. It's not a psychological examination into the subconscious nor is it a complex character study. So don't expect it to be one. Instead, the film aspires to be a mindbending adventure heist film set in the realms of dreams and in this regard, the film is flawless. With jawdropping and visceral sequences, it not only engages the intellect but also the emotions as it deals with guilt and loss and being haunted by your past. 	2
55	Jason X	Luminous. A richly textured and morally ambiguous satire of corporate greed and the the ethical morass that compels America's slashers into space. Also, there are boobs in it. 	2
56	Deadpool	Fuckin' A. Fuck 2.5-hour origin stories. Fuck who watches the watchmen. Fuck grade-school Nietzscheisms. Fuck angsting about using your powers. Fuck continuity. Fuck exposition. Fuck loners learning to be a team. Fuck spin-offs. Fuck politics. Fuck contrived misunderstandings. Fuck digital filters that make everything look grey. Fuck dark worlds. Fuck alternate universes. Fuck reboots. Fuck the X-Men. Fuck the MCU. Fuck DC. And fuck Deadpool while you're at it, but you'll have to get in line.	1
57	Let the Right One In	Dark, beautiful and thought provoking. I have to admit the swedes have made the best movie of 2008.	2
58	Memento	A nearly flawless movie.  Memento is a masterpiece of screenwriting and directing.  Not a single scene, shot, or facial expression is wasted.  Every tiny detail is deliberately set in place to clue the viewer in, but the non-linear story keeps us at just the right distance.  A perfectly balanced tight rope act.  Some call the backwards story a gimmick.  It's not.  Rather, it's a crucial tool in bringing us into Leonard's damaged mind.  We're not observing events, we're experiencing them.  	1
59	Hot Fuzz	Outstanding action comedy that manages to work as an over-the-top blockbuster while lovingly lampooning them at the same time. It really stands up to repeat viewings, because the jokes are hilarious, and there is no wasted dialog in the entire movie -- every word serves to set something up for later: it's very economic storytelling that you don't really notice until you see it a few times. The cast is terrific all the way through, especially Timothy Dalton. I find it impossible not to love this.	2
60	Moon	Really great minimalistic sci-fi debut; although the theme is not that complex, its exposition is spun out with great craft, allowing us to share the doubts of the main character while occupying an omniscient point of view. Humour is used well to alleviate the mood. At each plot point, the film seems to make exactly the right decision, and it's a pleasure to just sit back and be hand-held though to the end. The continuous why?s are all answered satisfactorily and with impeccable timing.	2
61	Anomalisa	Someone just stab Pickpocket in the face for the love of fuck EDIT: just saw his blog and he's a massive MRA too, god damn what a turd	0
62	Mission: Impossible - Fallout	Better and worse than the 5th one. The action scenes are exciting, though feel a bit reiterative of the last film (oh boy, another car chase through a European city). The plot is also a bit too bonkers, with the convoluted array of twists and double agents being either predictable or just too much. The elongated ending action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen, showing off some very stunning and ballsy stuntwork that is all an absolute marvel (heh) to watch.	0
63	2001: A Space Odyssey	Timeless - every time I watch this I'm sucked right into it - this is cinema in all its power and awe.	2
64	Drive	Driver's strong silence is that of a classic masculine film protagonist who chooses his words wisely. When he speaks, it's with a purpose; when he looks you in the eye, you damn well better listen. His bold, visceral reactions may shock, but show that he has a heart. There's a slick 80s style from the synth-pop soundtrack and hot-pink font, to Driver's scorpion bomber jacket. It's a sexy film without any sex; it's violent, though that violence happens in quick spikes. Daring and unforgettable. 	2
65	Interstellar	Huge excellent cast. Interesting, intelligent, exciting and engaging story. Great acting and dialog. Wonderful video, music, CGI and SFX. Fun to watch, even though very long. A few awe inspiring moments and if you can accept wormholes is at least somewhat plausible science . But, I didn't like the spooky messages in the dust. A little mushy at the end, but it was good closure to the story. Some flaws, but mostly good.	2
66	Into the Wild	I just could never get behind or all that interested in this guy's journey. He was just as self-absorbed as the parents he is supposedly rising above. If the film weren't so interested in romanticizing his journey, it might have had a better chance at success.	0
67	Thor: The Dark World	It's always fake Loki. It was fake Loki a bunch of times and I called it every time. Knowing that it is fake Loki is like curling up under a warm blanket. Thor will leave you to protect the nine realms but fake Loki will fake Loki fake Loki. See Thor saw fake Loki but knew it was fake Loki so he told fake Loki to real Loki to not fake Loki. Then real Loki real Loki'd, but then fake Loki'd while being real Loki so Thor thought fake Loki fake Loki...aw fuck it.  	2
68	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is everything a movie should be.  It's entertaining, it's funny, it's action packed, well acted, has a great score, has really impressive editing, and everything else is on such a high level that it's almost flawless.  There really aren't many films that can go up against this one and be compared favorably.  It's my pick for the best western ever made and it's almost my pick as the best foreign film ever made.  I love this movie.	2
69	Interstellar	Interstellar has shortcomings, but in such an immense display they fall by the wayside. This is the first Nolan film that's felt its length for me, but that's not necessarily bad because it also happens to be his dramatically heaviest film. He achieves something he's often been criticized for lacking: pathos. It's beautifully and uniquely done, as expected, and McConaughey trumps his Oscar-winning role with this performance. This succeeds where Gravity failed: it's a spectacle with a heart.	2
70	Slumdog Millionaire	I hate stories that revolve around ...it was destiny. Okay then why am I supposed to feel inspired or affected by what I just saw? (which is clearly the aim.) The uncaring hand of fate decided this random kid's story for him. Meanwhile the other 99.9% of the slumdogs are stuck in their shit hole , and they can't do a damn thing about it! It's their destiny! yaaaaay..?	0
71	Life of Pi	'Life of Pi' is somewhat of a catch-all religious odyssey aboard a lifeboat.  The ending is wobbly, the message opaque, but the journey is fantastic.  Visually, this is one of the most impressive films I've seen especially in terms of digital effects used to create incredibly lifelike animals.  'Life of Pi' is a tougher film than its PG rating suggests, and I'd advise parents to be cautious of the film's intensity.  Overall, however, I think this is an ambitious and imaginative adventure.	2
72	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	don't worry about spoilers...you've already seen the entire movie. in 1977! well, and '80, because they obviously knew how to pace back then. today's special is mostly a barrage of conveniently placed plot devices mixed with overzealous nostalgia appeasal. it's not all bad, and surely we don't need to discuss production values. but with everything at their disposal, the talent, an entire universe to pick from, all they come up with is a messy rehash? sorry yoda, seems there actually IS a try.	2
73	City of God	Interesting story of boys growing up in the slumps of Rio, one becoming a big gangster and the other trying to stay away from it. Also interesting extra's on the DVD about the drug-war between the police and the gangsters. 	2
74	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	The first half hour is overwhelming in its fluid mastery of light and darkness. Every thing, every totem in this world holds so much weight, so much history. And then, after all sorts of tremendously entertaining blockbuster shenanigans, it ends on the most important one. And you bet the audience could feel it.	2
75	Interstellar	According to the theory of relativity, that's roughly 21 years of my life I'll never get back.	2
76	Anaconda	my most popular review on criticker	2
77	Lost in Translation	Visual poetry.  What is truly refreshing about Lost in Translation is the honesty.  An honest romance film that doesn't pander to the audience and cop out with the ending.  Stated as overrated in many circles, I strongly disagree.  There have been few (if any) greater American love stories on film in the last decade.  Very few films can simultaneously make you feel happy inside, while also making you weep.  Murray was robbed.	2
78	Spring Breakers	Harmony Korine is like the bizarro Terrence Malick. Dayglo hedonism and hallucinatory editing. It's Girls Gone Wild for the arthouse crowd.	2
79	Moonrise Kingdom	Pierrot le fou for children. Wes Anderson for lovers. Bill Murray as an American treasure. Bruce Willis as someone who's uncool. Edward Norton as a funny scoutmaster. A gorgeous film. (two times)	0
80	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug	Shot on location in New Zealand's most picturesque green screens.	2
81	2001: A Space Odyssey	This is Kubrick's gem and film at its best.  What my eyes witnessed was fine tuned beauty within this universe, whether it be natural or artificial. This film makes your mind go in so many ways, as you watch and wonder; are we trying to understand the meaning of the film or the meaning of life itself? It also delivers the greatest villain of all time, HAL9K. 2001 is a fine example of the relationship between art and cinema. A sensory masterpiece.	2
82	Predator	So macho the dvd case had a five o'clock shadow and smelled of cigars.	1
83	Taken	Ahahaha, this movie is totally just 90 minutes of Liam Neeson beating on minorities in Europe and generally just fucking everyone's shit up with extreme prejudice.  It's pretty damn cool.	0
84	Avengers: Age of Ultron	Superhero overload. The last hour makes you never want to watch an action sequence again.	0
85	A Clockwork Orange	A Clockwork Orange always evokes interesting feelings. On one hand it's dark and frightening, but on another it's both funny and colourful. In A Clockwork Orange it's the atmosphere that creates the strongest emotions with me; the powerful music, fine acting and strong direction from Kubrick are all quite memorable.	2
86	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	I found this to be an infuriatingly inauthentic and cutesy depiction of America, violence, anger, and grief. McDonagh seems to treat the whole thing as a farce, then switch into heavy mode whenever it suits him. Totally uneven and lacking in any real semblance of humanism. McDormand, Rockwell, and Caleb Landry Jones (who stuck out for me personally) work with what their given, but it rings false. Biggest pile of bullshit I've been served from from the so-called awards contenders thus far.	0
87	Trance	The annoying thing about TRANCE is that, as a piece of technical filmmaking, it's often remarkable: the cinematography is marvelous (the use of color and shadow is outstanding), the sound and music are fine, and Danny Boyle directs his ass off. And the acting is solid; Rosario Dawson is effective, and Vincent Cassel is a perfect sleaze. But the script is the worst kind of fragmented thriller, with twists that simply irritate and an inconsistently drawn protagonist. After a while, it just bores.	0
88	Snowpiercer	The train is, like, a metaphor for society, bro...	1
89	Godzilla	Damnit! I waited too long to write this review, and now I can't remember a single thing from the movie.	0
90	Her	"OK, I don't know how to say this without sounding like I've gone around the bend, but barring some thoughts I haven't contemplated, and I've always steered away from saying something is my all time favorite, but this may be it. I've never been that impressed with Spike Jonze films before, but this one not only touched my soul, it enunciated things that I've kept pretty close to my chest.

I was looking forward to a good film, and the first half/two-thirds of it were about what I expected--exce"	0
91	Jesus Camp	Probably the most disturbing documentary I have ever seen,America and the world are in trouble when there are people like this in such high numbers practising this insanity.These people make Charles Manson look sensible.	2
92	Magnolia	PTA is a master of great pacing. People compare this to some of Altman's stuff (Nashville, Short Cuts) but Magnolia manages to get me to care about almost all of the characters and keep me interested during its lengthy runtime, something that Altman's sloppy ensemble pieces couldn't do.	2
93	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	I'm so confused. Everyone says it's better than the other two, yet I see the exact same terrible writing, poor direction and bombastic special effects. Fuck George Lucas.	0
94	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	It is so rare that you run into a movie that garners such high personal expectations, and on leaving the theatre, your dominant thought is, That was everything I wanted in this movie. The Force Awakens is everything I wanted it to be: an homage to the franchise's roots (some will undoubtedly argue that as re-hash/gross pandering), and a gateway to the next generation (and proof more than ever that JJ's got BALLS). As close to pitch-perfect as I could have ever hoped it to be. Literal chills.	2
95	The Seventh Seal	I don't know what's more impressive: how much Bergman has to say, or the fact that he can say it in 90 minutes.	2
96	Sweet Smell of Success	This movie is full of razor sharp dialogue, and Curtis and Lancaster sell it beautifully. Never have I seen two characters fight to see who can be an even bigger scumbag. 	2
97	Coyote Ugly	When I asked a few years ago, to some friends, what their favourite movie was, they always answered: Coyote Ugly. I watched it, and I hated it. What a shitload of fuck	0
98	Goodfellas	Scorsese's most personal film--these streets must be close to what asthmatic little Marty saw outside his childhood window--and made at the height of his powers.  Excelling at both montage and camera movement, Scorsese has the gift of knowing when each technique is most appropriate.  Gangster life as depicted here may be romanticized, but the gangsters themselves are not.  They are psychopaths, and Scorsese makes sure his audience knows it.	1
99	There Will Be Blood	Just perfect. Directing, cinematography, story, MUSIC, peformances, message, environment. All in all, just great movie. Sure Plainview was an unpleasant man, but how tormented he was. No real human contact. Man, how he tried to break his spell. The preacher was the only one who got the most heart of him. Pretty similar character opposites (or are they one and same character?) than in No Country for Old Men.	1
100	Looper	Back to the Future promised hoverboards in 30 years.  30 years later, Looper promises hover-cycles in 30 years.  GUYS.  Let's be real.  Not gonna happen.  That being said, the wireless ear bud technology, that's going to be here in time for Christmas next year.  In summary: I'm a hover-vehicle pessimist, but an ear bud optimist.	0
101	The Revenant	Less of a movie and more of a cinematic feat, The Revenant is beautiful in aesthetics and execution. Sporting some of the finest cinematography and most intricate direction I have ever seen, Inarritu leads Hardy, DiCaprio, Gleeson and Poulter for some amazing performances, acting out a brutal and rugged script. It's rough yet beautiful, brutal yet haunting. The Revenant is one that will stick with you.	2
102	Saving Private Ryan	If you ever see one WWII film, this should be it. Nothing comes close to defining the horror, chaos and soul-destroying emotions of war. Spielberg has provided a intensely brutal realistic outlook, gripping plotline and fantastic production values. This coupled with consistently stunning acting from everyone involved (yes, even Vin Diesel) brings all the varied personalities of the characters to life, making you genuinely care and feel the emotional weight when individuals are lost. Awesome.	2
103	Avatar	The effects are good, tactile even, but very gaudy and trendy-looking. The plot competently exhibits hallmarks of the adventure genre but it's hardly a meaningful indictment of imperialism; it is just money, material, and man-hours expended to the end of assuaging white guilt. The film's purposes require an /artist/ at the helm, and Cameron is merely a good craftsman. Avatar will deservedly fade with time; its legacy will be that of Fantastic Voyage, not Metropolis.	2
104	Exit Through the Gift Shop	I am beginning to regret spending $50,000 on my Mr. Brainwash collection.	0
105	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	The only reason people are eating this up is deep down they are watching a rehashed and updated version of A New Hope, yet they fool themselves into thinking this movie is a step forward. I have no faith in JJ because he likes to play it safe (but he calls it paying homage, remember Star Trek?) and makes sure the the movie won't flop. I'm pretty sure he is out of ideas, and I have no hope for the next installment. 	2
106	Home Alone 4	I haven't seen this movie, but I hate it anyway because the kid on the box is a douchebag.	1
107	Avengers: Infinity War	Such a gigantic movie with so many characters & so much going on, it’s hard to talk about without spoilers. I really enjoyed it. It was continually exciting to see all these characters returning & some meeting each other for the 1st time. And you know who’s really great in this? Thanos. If you’re already invested in these movies, I’m pretty sure you’re going to enjoy it. I don’t know if it’s the best one yet, but it’s up there, & certainly the most impressive, in a lot of ways.	2
108	District 9	It boggles the mind how a movie made for $30 million can produce what  many gigantic blockbusting titles fail to achieve.  The acting was spot on, writing was gripping, and the action tight.  We need to stay away from big studios more often apparently.  Oh, and someone is kicking themselves for not giving this guy a chance on Halo, actually they likely lost thier job. 	2
109	Grindhouse	You'll get your money's worth with this one.  PLANET TERROR is gross, silly, and a lot of fun.  After some great fake trailers DEATH PROOF sorta slows the whole thing down. The inconsistent tone and pace may be intentional, but the long dialogue scenes feel out of place, and the first batch of unlikeable characters are developed for too long.  Fortunately it leads up to a decent car chase and a what the hell was that kind of ending.  Overall, GRINDHOUSE mostly succeeds with the theme.	0
110	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Outstanding, rip-roaring adventure still feels fresh and contemporary 30+ years later, anchored by Ford's authoritative, iconic performance as a kind of messy, capable but clumsy everyman spin on Bond, and the directorial smarts of Spielberg who keeps things moving at a break-neck speed while stopping just shy of exhausting his audience. Atmospheric photography and vivid location shooting also a definite plus. If the plotting is a little thin at times, it would seem foolish to complain.	1
111	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Phenomenally, incredibly bad. The editing is a mess, the story is weak (and once again takes things from canon only to twist them into something random), and it's full of inexplicable and unappealing elements: several Decepticons can now spit, there's robot humping, robot balls, the insulting and stupid twins, and then there's the Matrix of Leadership, which disappears when you touch it because you don't physically need it, except for later when it reappears because you do. Unbelievable.	0
112	Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones	Managed the seemingly impossible feat of not meeting the lowest expectations I've ever had for a movie. Like expecting to be diagnosed with stomach cancer only to find out you've been impregnated by a xenomorph.	1
113	Nymphomaniac: Volume 1	"Unlike your cock it will definitely grow on you. Unlike most cocks it is way to long.
Unlike anyones cock it needs an extra viewing."	2
114	Warrior	Imagine the pitch meeting: It's not just an underdog sports story -- it's a DOUBLE underdog sports story! . . . I dunno. Where's the sentiment? . . . They're brothers! . . . Gonna need more . . . Their estranged father is the grizzled trainer! . . . More . . . One of them's a war hero! . . . More . . . The other's a public school teacher that can't pay his mortgage! . . . More . . . The war hero sends money to his dead friend's wife! . . . You get the picture.	2
115	The Help	Oh my God... Probably the most pushing-all-the-right-sentimental-buttons movie in years, with an all-star line-up of card-board characters presented by actors over-acting in the extreme. It works occasionally but this is by heart a TV movie.  	2
116	Falling Down	A compelling and somewhat sad story about what happens when stress just becomes too much for one man on a sunny morning in California. This is definitely one of Michael Douglas' most powerful performances, and the supporting actors hold up well, too.	2
117	Patch Adams	Ironically, this movie about a doctor who celebrates life will make you want to kill yourself.	2
118	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	"Get ready for another Batman origin.....in slow motion!  The writing and creative team take a bunch of concepts and ideas from the comics, don't complete any of them, and jumble together a frankly boring mess.  There were no problems with any of the acting performances, but the writing was complete shit.  Lex Luthor was essentially a Joker clone (which is a crying shame), and all of the shoe-horning of the JL hero stuff was eye-rollingly forced.

I expected little, and Snyder always delivers.
"	0
119	Casablanca	I still get emotional watching this film.  One of the few films that really does live up to its hype.	1
120	Interstellar	A tone-deaf, borderline laughable first hour.  A brilliant, lush, gripping space opera in the middle.  Then one of the most ludicrous, most ill-conceived, most flat-out frigging dumb wrapups you'll ever see.  Might be worth watching for that genuinely awesome midsection, but it's basically pulp, and nowhere near as Profound-n-Beautiful as it thinks it is.	0
121	Inland Empire	David Lynch has out-Lynched himself, and it seems he is out of his mind. In all seriousness though, I did enjoy portions of the film. The bits with Jeremy Irons and the interplay between Dern's character's personal life and the film she is making are really great. However, often it seems as if Lynch is almost parodying himself. He already perfected this story with Mulholland Drive. Even as a big Lynch fan, I was a bit weirded out. An interesting experience to be sure.	2
122	Batman & Robin	If you love Batman, this movie makes you angry.  If you love a tasteful parody, this movie makes you furious at how taste and humor have been pile-driven into the dirt.  This artless, rubber-nippled, shiny explosion of everything annoying will forever be George Clooney's and even Arnold Schwarzenegger's worst film.  It's an obnoxious romp through Joel Schumacher's ADHD Gotham City.  Total crap!	0
123	The Warriors	While definitely filled with the typical 70's-80's movie cheese, it's cheesy 70's-80's done right. It's brimming with personality with its outlandish characters, great pacing and very entertaining fight scenes. Definitely a must see.	2
124	Paths of Glory	Simply stunning. Kubrick provides a harrowing look at the internal mechanics of the military organization. He manages to avoid treading the all too familiar ground of many war movies--the straightforward rejection of the violence and cruelty of war. We know war is violent. We know war is cruel. Kubrick is not one to craft something so simple. This film is a complex drama that defies the boundaries of conventions, while showcasing them with dazzling effect. A masterpiece.	1
125	A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence	As much as Andersson's style is unique and intriguing, a third film in the span of 14 years rehashing the exact same format and themes strikes me a sign of stagnation. En duva satt på en gren och funderade på tillvaron seems to be packed with less neat surrealistic twists than the previous two and, although it's still an odd, thought-provoking creature, I feel that Andersson fails to communicate anything truly original.	1
126	Shame	Shame articulates a shallow, even mundane, understanding of an uninteresting man's sex addiction--in a vibrant city rendered dull and anonymous. - Ed Gonzalez	0
127	The Dark Knight	Couldn't grade it after one pass (I was afraid I'd be overcome with hyperbole) so I saw it a second time in IMAX for a more critical viewing and, I can happily report that his is complex and ACCESSIBLE film-making at its finest. The plot is so dense that repeated viewings should really be a requirement. Bale and Eckhart bring the goods, and of course, Ledger is off-the-charts. But how great is this movie, that his iconic Joker couldn't overshadow what is a fantastic piece of pop entertainment?	1
128	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Star Wars is back baby! Not as good as Empire but better than Jedi. You heard me. Goes without saying it's better than the prequels combined. This is on par with New Hope...actually it's quite similar. Daisy Ridley is a rock star and has a bright future in showbiz (take that Hayden!) Can't wait for Rogue One.	2
129	Twin Peaks	Yes this is pure uncut Lynch heroin. My mind was in a state of perpetual blowing up & my face was frozen in a dorky grin. Meticulously unsolves Laura Palmer's murder & envelops it in beautifully layered mystery as it was always meant to be. Hilarious, intriguing, bewildering, horrifying, heartbreaking, pulpy & classy often simultaneously. A willful compendium of Lynch's most harrowing & dreamlike work that is as deeply human as it is absurd & bizarre. The finale is existential shock & awe.	2
130	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	1991..the year Cameron made the best SciFi-Action movie of all time. With a monster budget of 94. Million $ ( that was a record in 1991 ) he created a movie that stands for a whole generation. Dark, brutal and dystopian. A movie with no hope and no happy end.130 thrilling minutes full of action you've never seen before. Terminator is an inherent part of the 90's. Judgement day will come, it's just a matter of time	0
131	Avengers: Infinity War	Infinity War is gigantic in every sense of the word and I applaud the Russo's. It was some task to bring all of these characters together and some of the most enjoyable moments are seeing characters either reunite or meet one another for the first time. But ultimately this film belongs to Thanos who is an incredibly well realised villain and the best in the MCU to date. As expected the set pieces are frantically enjoyable throughout and it will be interesting to see how Part 2 concludes.	2
132	10 Cloverfield Lane	Rumour has it Daniel Trachtenberg was 3/4 into the movie Misery when his DVD suddenly cut to War Of The Worlds. He silently nodded his head in approval.	1
133	Dunkirk	imagine being a soldier surviving from a war where you didn't expect to come out alive: you're disheveled, confused, and not sure what it means that you made it out and not someone else... and then being like, 'yeah but what about da character development and what was everybody's names tho, lol?'	2
134	Get Out	Really outstanding and the type of movie you should know as little about as possible going in.  I'm very impressed with the direction and how incredibly tight this script was.  Honestly not one second of filler in the whole thing.  Edit: On second viewing, it's even more tightly scripted than I thought.  This is probably the best script of the last decade.	2
135	Noah	Were there rock-angel-Transformers voiced by Nick Nolte in the bible? I got NOAHDEA	1
136	Antichrist	Typical Toronto Film Festival fare: a generally dull movie where nothing much happens but the director is clearly trying hard to be artistic in the process of not advancing the plot (since there isn't one to advance), then there are some images that people aren't used to seeing on a big screen so half of the mostly self-important viewers act 'shocked' while the other half talk in hushed tones about how 'courageous' the director is.    *yawn*    It's the same routine every year. Not impressed.	1
137	Whiplash	Whiplash keeps it safe by using the same basic setup of literally every sports movie ever made, but instead 'sports' is now 'drums' and the coach is a gentrified version of Full Metal Jacket's  Drill Instructor. 	0
138	Inception	As the storyline takes it's enjoyable onion-structured form, one might suspect Inception is trying to appear more intelligent than it actually is. With strong performances and striking visuals, the film is marvellous to look at, and often emotionally engaging - but there is all too little of the existential mindfuck that could have made this an instant classic. The 'what if' ending is the unnecessary cherry on top of a cake that never tastes as sweet as it could have - and should have.	1
139	Ready Player One	No charm, nothing, really nothing to say and ultimately poisoned with oh, the beautiful girl has a scratch in her cute face and the boy becomes the freaking HERO for saying that it's not a freaking PROBLEM for him. How brave! And I don't even want to go into the inability to understand the details and problems of gaming culture this movie has. Spielberg is such a dad. Unable to analyze his own nerdiness or his own black and white worldview. But hey, no gaming Tuesdays and Thursdays, ok?! Gosh!	1
140	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Nonstop visual and aural abuse for almost three straight hours - grinding metal, booming voices, seizure-inducing camerawork, and endless, gratuitous explosions are paused briefly only for atrocious dialog, sub-par acting, stupid gags, and tedious exposition into its incomprehensible plot.  Only Michael Bay could construct an experience this masochistic and grating to the senses.  The Geneva Convention should outlaw this piece of shit.	0
141	Dredd	Guess we don't need that Robocop remake anymore.	1
142	Hot Fuzz	It's no surprise that the team of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have crafted a follow-up to Shaun of the Dead that's just as giddily engaging as their comic zombie romp. It is, however, a little startling to discover how good Pegg is at playing a wildly different character than his layabout hero Shaun. The screenplay is wonderfully constructed with sly details paying off beautifully in a third act that expertly mocks Hollywood action movies while gleefully reveling in their excess.	2
143	Scenes from a Marriage	Lip-knawingly real. The complexes of life, love, and intellect. No one is safe, least so the viewer. The script of a wise man.	0
144	Crash	WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE	1
145	Inception	There's only one problem: I didn't give a fuck about Cobb's wife, Cobb's children, and Cobb's feeling of guilt. Not a bit. Unfortunately, almost the whole movie was about that.	0
146	Cocoon	They travel trillions of light years and they want old people and Steve Guttenberg. Advanced civilization my arse.	1
147	Blood Freak	While I admit my experience with the genre is somewhat limited, this might just be the best pro-FDA bible-thumping marijuana-moral-panicking vampiric-turkey horror movie ever made.	0
148	Eighth Grade	A masterclass in honest and empathetic filmmaking. Burnham is damn good at capturing the bottomless horror of adolescence: the cruelty, the loneliness, the rush when things go your way and that horrible comedown when they don't. This reminded me of Lady Bird in its miraculous avoiding of false notes and its ability to make me care for someone seemingly so different from myself but uncannily familiar at the same time. And for making me cry-cry and laugh-cry within mere minutes of each other.	2
149	Drive	It was like Taxi Driver minus the characters and the dialogue, directed by instagram	1
150	Batman Begins	Easily the best Batman movie ever. They somehow fit a full explaining of the character's backstory, roots and motivations, along with great villains, into roughly 2 hours. Simply outstanding. Improves greatly upon repeated viewings. Has to lose 4 points because of Katie Holmes.	2
151	Gone with the Wind	If someone suggested a 4-hour glossy melodrama about the loves and losses of aristocratic Nazis set against the backdrop of WW2, with occasional comic interludes by a token house Jew, they'd be drummed out of town. But right at the beginning of World War 2 this came out and is somehow considered a classic.	2
152	Inglourious Basterds	Tarantino continues to pump out incredibly entertaining cinema. The writing was top notch (as expected), utilization of a great soundtrack, memorable characters, great story, surprising performance from Christoph Waltz, and killin' Natzis. This movie's got it all. Best of '09.	2
153	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Star Wars films should be exciting and leave you with a smile on your face, This was exciting and left me with a smile on my face.	2
154	The Dark Crystal	Really creepy puppets.  My movie watching experience was forever tainted by a kid next to me jerking off to the female puppet.  Can't watch this film the same way since. 	0
155	Baby Driver	If you can make it through the first 30 minutes of watching some wanker lip-syncing to pop music, all you get is a tired, off-the-shelf heist movie with characters so empty you never give a shit what happens to any of them. The script is bland, action scenes poor, and the whole thing comes across not as cool, but cringeworthy. I had no idea about the hype around this film until after I'd seen it, and it baffles me. I thought this wannabe-Tarantino rubbish was done with by the late '90s.	0
156	Joker	Frustrating. It's beautifully shot and scored, and Phoenix delivers a performance for the ages but the film around it falls short of the mark. It has a lot on its mind and tries its best to talk about a host of issues from mental health to income inequality, but it also lazily and brazenly steals from the best of Scorsese and when asked to articulate its big ideas with the nuance and deftness of the films it admires it lazily settles for Eh, society, amirite? Still worth a watch. 	2
157	They Live	jesus christ, keith david, just put on the damn sunglasses.	1
158	Gran Torino	"C. Eastwood is not too old for being an actor. Great movie of him, a role of rascist that he played perfectly well, one of his best movies.
      A movie that is very enjoyable for everyone : action, drama and a comedy.  I must confess a surprisingly end."	2
159	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	The film I hoped TFA would have been. RO is a fleshed out, mature film I highly appreciate after the somewhat kiddie episode 7, which left me feeling a bit mixed. RO reminded me of 'Empire', as it is quite dark and serious in tone. To be frank, this is how I like my cup of Star Wars. Edwards has created a great installment, along with the solid cast, strong script and marvelous CGI effects. Oh, that last scene with Vader, nerdgasm galore. I saw it in 3D, even though I hate it it was still great!	2
160	Inglourious Basterds	A cleverly and ambitiously written World War II film. The majority of the cast acted superbly and the plot was great yet obviously extremely unrealistic. The characters were engrossing, the tension scenes were unbearable (in a good way) and the soundtrack was great. I do feel that the music did overpower some scenes though in terms of volume, especially when building tension, but that's just me nitpicking. But yeah, overall, a really good film that's definitely worth watching.	2
161	The Expendables	WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT, HULK HOGAN, BATMAN OR SANTA CLAUS	1
162	Justice League	We did it, we the internet critics won. We criticized the prior DCEU movies to such a degree that they just decided to stop trying to  be unique, and they just made a generic family-friendly Marvel movie. 	2
163	Edge of Tomorrow	A sharp, funny romp that makes good on the promise of its premise - and that alone merits a recommendation. Cruise is on decent form and Blunt makes for an excellent co-star. Comparisons to other movies, some of them better, are rife and inevitable, but Edge of Tomorrow is an enjoyable enough ride to be judged and rewarded on its own terms. Pleasant surprise.	2
164	American Hustle	I was really struggling to keep my concentration for this. At one point I considered walking out. I think you could cut out about an hour from the middle and lose nothing, because nothing happened. It manages a few chuckles but there's no plot! They just tried to cram as many A-listers in as they could and gave them absolutely nothing to do! They have the set up at the beginning and then basically abandon it until the end. There's no build up. It's a poor man's Boogie Nights.  Just rewatch that!	0
165	Her	The most amazing thing to me is how genuine Jonze makes this world feel, but also how genuine Phoenix makes the relationship with an OS feel. It easily feels like it's our near future, thanks in large part to the brilliant cinematography and set design. The settings and gadgets (and video games!) all blend wonderfully, making moments like the admission of dating an OS appear seamlessly believable. 	2
166	Jurassic World	As a lifelong fan of cinema, I find it discouraging that the global audience continues to reward mediocrity. This shattered the opening weekend box office record?? The msg we send is clear: characters, story and quality are not important to us. I don't think this is terrible by any means, but it plays it too safe; it doesn't try to be the best it can be and reach its potential - yet, we reward them with a massive bonus anyway! What incentive is there for studios to work hard and make great film?	2
167	Casablanca	If a greater movie was ever made by Hollywood, it must be in very scarce company indeed.  Most films are lucky if they spawn one memorable line; Casablanca has a whole page.  People even name other films after its lines!  We first meet Rick playing chess (Bogie's own idea--he was by far the best chess player in Hollywood, and indeed used to make a living hustling games in his early days in New York when acting jobs were scarce).  The screenplay was named best ever by some bigshot panel or other.	1
168	Gravity	Alfonso Cuaron's space epic is narratively slight, but what it lacks in depth it more than makes up in terms of technical wizardry and spectacle. Cuaron's precise direction and Lubezki's series of long takes make it a space opera that is much like a outer space ballet. Sandra Bullock does surprisingly well carrying the film for 88 minutes and brings some much needed emotional heft to the story. Gravity is also the first film that I would say is essential to be seen in 3D. 	2
169	Yojimbo	Kurosawa's bloody-minded political parable about the struggle for supremacy in a godforsaken 17th-century rural village. The feudists on both sides are uniformly petty, pea-brained, and baboonish (the only thing protecting them from one another is their cowardice), and justice is done when an unemployed samurai wanders into their midst and capriciously slaughters them all.	2
170	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies	Finally, a film in this series I can just call BAD. Most of the plot is completely divorced from the source material--which I would NEVER use as a negative except that this creative team has shown that their original ideas are lame as hell. When Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee's body double were twirling their swords at a bunch of spooky CG ghosts, it became bad enough to be entertaining. The rest of the movie is just dull. Like Bilbo I spent most of the movie just staring at things happening.	0
171	Eighth Grade	There hasn't been a scarier film released in years. I felt tense the entire time. 	0
172	The Revenant	"DANCES WITH BEARS (starring Tom Hardy as The Bear)
"	1
173	Imitation of Life	Behind all the artificiality and finesse, this is as earnest, honest and gritty as a Cassavetes... Beautiful, fucking beautiful - harsh and funny; it's throbbing and salient melodrama, addressing shitloads of issues, speaking with fluid words in an amplified tone, indeed, but doing so with a consistency and pertinaciousness and such a big fucking heart. As the film, these words may be corny - but they're not false.	2
174	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	A sixty five is pretty generous but i have a soft spot for shit that transforms into other shit.	2
175	Heavy Metal	Your stoner uncle's music collection meets your stoner uncle's porno collection...	0
176	Hidden Figures	A little heavy on 'stick it to the white man' feel good moments as you got a double dose of Jim Parsons & Kirsten Dunst's caricatures serving the same purpose, but boy what a hoot Hidden Figures (2016) was! Excellent capturing the early times of the space program. A little puzzled by Octavia Spencer getting a Oscar nod and not Taraji P. Henson. With that said, all-round great performances by the dames, including Janelle Monáe, delivering a fine tribute to the black ladies of NASA!	2
177	Dracula	Badly directed, badly edited and bad acting with the extremely notable exceptions of Frye and Lugosi, who saved this film from being a disaster.  The set design is also worth a mention as the castle set is fantastic   However, the film suffers from huge plotholes, fifty shots of just Dracula's face and one of the most anti-climactic climaxes I've yet seen.  Worth a watch if only for how influential it was and the aforementioned acting and early sets, but it's not a good movie.	0
178	Pan's Labyrinth	One of my favourite films, and one I could quite happily watch over and over again. I love the fusion of terrifying fantasy and real-life brutality, and like the way del Toro doesn't go too far towards the fantasy elements. At its heart, it's not a film about fairies and fauns; it's a film about a scared little girl in an unimaginably horrific situation, and how she copes with it. It has great acting, great music, great visuals... I would be surprised if del Toro ever hits these heights again.	2
179	Hereditary	Greek tragedies are about the punishment for transgressing the law and acting against the tradition. Here, we have an alienated & dysfunctional family unable to grieve properly for their loss (grandma and Charlie). This leads to the brutal punishment of the father & the son (similar to Greek Gods' execution of a punishment in mythology) to recuperate the matriarch's law. Brings a few novelties to the genre eschewing the cliches of classical horror. Dream sequence was one of a kind. Good job.	1
180	Submarine	Decent, but it progressively gets more and more boring as it goes, as well as being familiarly indie-quirky in a progressively more annoying way. Not a bad debut, though, some good visuals and lines.	2
181	Werckmeister Harmonies	Wow. This is an amazing film. The opening bar bit and the hospital attack are two of the best scenes I have ever seen. A totally unique director. Reminds me of a Tarkovsky that has watched a lot of David Lynch films.	2
182	The Grand Budapest Hotel	The world building alone is incredible. Like all of Anderson's movies, it's heavy on dry wit with many instances of high absurdity measured with perfect moments of emotional impact. His storytelling methods have grown exponentially and this may be his most ambitious yet. It's the kind of movie fans of his will want to savour and live in long after it's finished.	2
183	Daisies	Godard on crystal meth.	1
184	BlacKkKlansman	Neither clever or outrageous enough to work as satire or farce, it is caught in no man's land, delivering utterly predictable social commentary that is too comfortable conforming to the current reductive mindset about race and class. Despite the promising alignment of Afro-American and Jewish concerns, no real chances are taken, and the Klan members are presented as bumbling stereotypes. The news footage connecting Trump to recent tragic events is also tacky and manipulative.	2
185	Pacific Rim	Is it a great movie that'll stand the rest of time? No. Is it an incredibly fun, incredibly dumb, incredibly well-made robot vs. monster game that was completely entertaining on an IMAX screen? Oh sweet Lord, yes.	2
186	Black Hawk Down	Again the United States do not lose the opportunity for demonstrating his ideological hypocrisy.	1
187	Deadpool	Reynolds is to Deadpool, what Robert Downey jr. is to Ironman. Made for the part. Deadpool is a perfect mix of funny, gore and nerdgasm. The story itself is rather thin but the fun and high tempo of the movie makes up for this. Funniest super-hero movie i've seen for a while. Good on you Reynolds. Finally a movie that understands the character of Deadpool.	2
188	Man of Steel	Man of Steel is like being beaten around the head with Freudian imagery, Christ allegories, and product placement. And then you get to see cool scenes of people being beaten around the head while flying.	0
189	2001: A Space Odyssey	Yes, yes. I know. Maybe I just didn't get it. But my god, what a fucking boring movie. It's like they were intentionally fucking with you... hey, let's see if we can get away with this guy breathing over and over again for 20 minutes!. Yeah, I don't give a shit if it's supposed to make you feel like you're there or whatever. It's still fucking MINUTES UPON MINUTES OF NOTHING HAPPENING. THAT IS NOT GOOD FILM. And the ending? What a cop out. 	1
190	The Cabin in the Woods	Epochal. First, there was horror. Then there was Scream, and it effectively created the metahorror genre. The Cabin in the Woods is the end of all things, the Omega of Horror. It puts the nail in the coffin that Scream built.  SEE THIS MOVIE NOW.	1
191	Man Bites Dog	Curbed me from pursuing my boom mic career. 	1
192	WALL·E	A truly great love story...in an animated movie...between robots. It sounds ridiculous, but that's what Pixar has crafted. Most credit is due, though, to Andrew Stanton's excellent vision and direction, which are virtually unmatched in his field. A beautiful, heart-wrenching adventure.	2
193	Full Metal Jacket	The first part of the film is absolutely BRILLIANT... the story, the acting, the directing is amazing. However the movie lost me at the second part. It got a lot weaker as it progressed. The directing is still amazing, but the story isn't that interesting. But the first half more than makes up for the second.	2
194	Aliens	told from the point of view of prolific planet colonialists. here they're shown as peaceful settlers, but as all national expeditions go, some repression is inevitable. unrest results, some of it violent, culminating in an attack on a settler family close to their village. this reactionary terrorism gives an excuse for our heroes to perform total genocide. like lord of the rings & star wars, but worse: the scene where ripley slaughters the children of the creature is horrifying and despicable.	0
195	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	At some point you realize that the narrative structure and characters are copied from a new hope. Maybe not shot by shot but it is pretty to being the exact same movie as a new hope. However, by the time you realize that, you've already had pretty good time.. 	2
196	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Ghastly vacuous porn: military porn, shiny car porn, kewl cgi porn and actual young women filmed like they're porn stars. Worse, a pair of robots do an urban minstrel show for comic relief. It's all pretty vile. Aside from all that, the action sequences (which are the big sell for this) are visually incomprehensible, with no clear sense of what we're looking at or where we are at any moment: this is what happens when you outsource your film to a cgi company and let them invent it all for you.	0
197	The Twilight Saga: New Moon	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. You'd assume after the commercial success of Twilight that it's first sequel would be bigger, better, and at the very least an averagely entertaining film. You'd be wrong. New Moon has all of the same issues as Twilight, only to a much more severe degree. Kristen Stewart's performance is so bad it's embarrassing to watch, and the rest of the cast do no better. The only reason I give this a 10 is because a Thom Yorke song is featured in it. Great song, too.	0
198	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Child rapist with a history of violence weasels out of punishment and kicks back in a hospital, where he proceeds to terrorize the staff and interfere with the treatment of sick people; is eventually murdered in his sleep by another patient.	0
199	Jurassic World	Somewhere between Sharknado and Snakes on a Plane, with a gratuitous amount of callbacks to Jurassic Park and Aliens.	1
200	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies	What happened to Billy Connelly afterwards? Did the Elves leave empty handed after the huge battle they lost platoons of troops in? How did that guy know to turn up with eagles? Why did P.J. cut out the sequence where Bilbo leaves the town and goes back into the mountain to tell the King he was a thief? What did the lake people do, just stay there? What did the Dwarves do with no obvious next in line for the throne? Do wizards have arbitrary amounts of power? WHAT? I should watch LOTR again.	1
201	Days of Heaven	I would say it's redundant to mention how stunningly and beautifully Days of Heaven is photographed, but it really can't be said enough. What is equally stunning and beautiful, though, is everything else about the film - the poetry of the narration; the wonderful score; the subtle examination of love and trust, of morality and human nature, of life and death. This is one of my favorite movies.	2
202	The Lighthouse	This is one of those films where you could take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery	2
203	Slender Man	For crying out loud it's 2018 can we stop with the body shaming. Of course Hollywood is only interested in a movie called Slender Man. When's Thicc Man coming out. Smh	0
204	The Babadook	A silly, scary movie about the living hell that it is to be a parent. 	0
205	Into the Wild	This is the most meaningless story of an ignorant and idiot boy (who doesn't know that happiness is real only shared, though he acts as if he is some kind of philosopher). Truly an annoying film, i had better forget at once!	0
206	The Dark Knight	I tried my level-best to find something about this film which I dislike, but came up empty handed. The storyline is a dark and intelligent crime-thriller and never devolves into the campy self-parody that has plagued many prior Batman films. All actors involved deliver top-drawer performances and Ledger creates the most memorable on-screen villain in at least a decade. It'll take something special to unseat TDK as my pick for Best Picture of 2008.	2
207	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood	My mom’s shoe fell off in the middle of the movie and she had to scramble to put it back on before Tarantino cast her in his next picture.	0
208	City of God	So Brazil isn't really like that. I don't care, this is beautifully shot, and unusually for a subtitled film absolutely gripping. Simply wonderful.	2
209	The Room	The epic tale of Johnny, who said hi to many people, threw a football around, was torn apart by Lisa and kept his comments in his pocket without breaking in to an emotion.  Fantastic stuff.  Mainly because its so terribly bad.  Like bad soft core porn, with all of the good sex bits taken out	0
210	Whiplash	This could have been an absorbing portrait of the student-teacher dynamic, or maybe an intelligent rumination on the nature of creativity, or the abuse of power, but instead it heads off into 'Rocky' territory where merely wanting something badly enough and having a good work ethic guarantees results in the end - the most prevalent and tired theme in all of American mainstream films. Simmons is brilliant though.	1
211	Mad Max: Fury Road	I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching an action movie. It's essentially made up of multiple violent, high-octane chase sequences with brief areas of calm story progression, but the action scenes contain so many careful subtleties that the film's world and characters really become fully fleshed out in the process of mind-bogglingly exhilarating filmmaking. With everything it was trying, this movie got it all right. 	1
212	Naked	From the start you get the feeling this isn't a very subtle film, and Thewlis owns the screen all the way through. Top part of the film for me will always be with the night watchman though, where they seem to bond, sort of. Only time Thewlis has an inkling of likeability(I love him though) about him. But even though he's an asshole, he always has a thought through reason for his venomous tirades, a way to back it up it you might say. Also see it as a well placed attack on Thatcherism.	1
213	Elvira, Mistress of the Dark	Am I weird or is the black tar being poured on Elvira sexier than gold dust? Anyways if Cassandra's soft focus boudoir strip tease doesn't get your heart racing then you should check your pulse, while her other talents shine through just as well throughout... like her gams.	2
214	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	a huge step back from episode vii, the last jedi is meandering mess of convoluted sub-plots and a weak storyline that runs a whopping 2.5 hours. there are deus ex machinas galore, and huge jumps in plot points towards the end in an effort to reduce the runtime. none of the characters develop further from the first movie and kylo ren is just a weak villain who has no menacing presence. and by the way, wtf was that force-skype bs? seriously.	1
215	King Kong	This is it -- the gargantuan, all-powerful classic that tramples everything in its path! Even when it was available only in a bowdlerized, darkened state it was still a giant among movies. Now that it's been fully restored, it takes its place as the King of Depression-era Hollywood. A great, full-blooded circus sideshow of a movie.	0
216	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	There's something ritualistic about the pleasures of Star Wars that softens the disappointment of recycled stories, characters, and even lines of dialogue. Don't want to get too pretentious here, but it's not a stretch to say Star Wars is our pop culture church, and the true believer embraces that familiarity. 	2
217	The Fountain	The true genius of the film is the simplistic theme of love and death. It allows for a creative narrative structure and beautiful visual moments while still being relatable. The only flaw is that the huge budget cuts make the Mayan fight scene seem very small and low budget. It does however not change the fact that this is my favorite movie, my favorite acting performance and by far my favorite score. The final scene that resolves the three storylines is the most magical moment in cinema history	2
218	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1	I predict that during Hunger Games marathons, this movie will be known as The Hunger Games: Shall We Just Skip This One?	0
219	Only God Forgives	Completely relentless in its violent tableaux. Filmed, no, painted in striking colors by Kubrick's old lighting photographer Larry Smith, and certainly with stylistic inspirations from The Shining and Eyes Wide Shot. It's a violent poem of metaphysical aesthetics. But Refn is no Tarkovskij. In reality you are left emotionally numb by the basic moral family melodrama.	2
220	Persona	Simply the boldest dive into the dark abyss of the human mind, that has ever been put on film. An abstract work of art, that resonates through expressionist imagery and the way it invites the viewer to a dialogue, dealing with the fragileness of the individual in modern society and our often irrational nature. I have an everlasting intellectual and emotional commitment to this film, even though it never can live up to the impact it had on me upon first viewing it.	2
221	Breaking Bad	It amazes me to this day how much of this show the writers made up as it went. As it progresses, it goes from good to great to HOLY GOD HOW THE FUCK DOES A SHOW THIS AMAZING EXIST IN A WORLD BOUNDED BY THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS?! This show contains some of the best characterization, and character moments, I've ever seen anywhere. It beautifully, perfectly accomplishes exactly the kind of things that take years of trust and knowledge of the characters to build, and it all works.	2
222	The Revenant	Beautiful scenery. Far too damn long, seriously this is getting on my nerves everyone insisting on making 140+ mins films. Tom Hardy was unrecognisable again, I had no idea it was him until just writing this review. Unnecessary gore to be super-edgy, unnecessary dream sequences to pad time, unnecessary red Indian hokum to add I don't care what. Iñárritu continues to annoy me and it could have done with a bear rape scene or two	0
223	Avengers: Endgame	I'm just happy it's finally over. (It's over, right? Please someone tell me it's over)	2
224	Saving Private Ryan	This is what an action war movie should be. First five mintues of viewing and you will know what you are in for. Don't get me wrong, sure there is killings, but that's not what makes this a great film. The story, the actors, the realism, all that along with some terrific action scenes make Saving Private Ryan the masterpiece it is.	2
225	The Thing	Changed my mind, went the 100, bearing in mind this the only flim I went to the drive in see (I don't drive and had to talk my brother in law who REALLY hates me into taking me)  John Carpenter at his gory best and apparently more faithful to John W Campbell's book who goes there.  The Alien is simply astonishing	2
226	Annihilation	Overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. It has moments of utter brilliance, but it's too focused on plot and trying to have some coherence. If they just decided to say fuck it and go for complete surreal madness we would have a masterpiece. Still if you'd wanted to see just one film from 2018, this is the one.	1
227	Zootopia	I liked Zootopia a lot, but all I could think about the whole time was what are all these animals eating to stay alive?	1
228	Mad Max: Fury Road	miller steps back into action as if he never left, injecting back something that's been missing from the genre with rare exceptions: pure, unashamed straightup adrenaline. it says a lot that most of the action in the trailer comes from the first half of the film and the opening sequence to the movie-long chase would be an action finale in any other film. lots of perfect creepy dystopian future touches and surprisingly well done humor. LOVED the heavy metal vehicle with the flamethrowing guitar	2
229	Eighth Grade	Not only is the child acting the best in recent years, Burnham manages to capture the energy of youth so superbly that it's amazing. It's all in the details, how he captured the age and era. Turns out as a 33 year old watching this, growing up with social media hasn't much changed the dynamics of youth.	2
230	The Exterminating Angel	i'm never entering a room again in my life	0
231	Les Misérables	Riddled with stretches of boredom and the most awkward camerawork ever to be projected, Les Misérables accomplishes nothing as a film. Instead, it is a myriad of scenes composed to entice emotion. In a handful, particularly those involving Hathaway and the rebels, the music is enough to satiate, but ultimately, most of the film sputters. Hooper, whose previous film suffered from a similar mediocrity, is currently my least favorite filmmaker. He delivers exactly what is expected of him. No balls.	1
232	Cloud Atlas	Yes, it is ambitious. We get it. But many of its storylines are underdeveloped or feel uncompleted. The politics are quite naive. And uneven makeup job is extremely distracting. Doesn't really work as something more than a huge cross-cutting experiment. A disappointment for me. 	0
233	There Will Be Blood	There will be blood has given me one of the most sincere feelings of true art. It's a phenomenal exploration of the psyche of Daniel Plainview, an incredible portraylal of cold blood capitalism vs. religious fanaticism, and a 'tour de force' from both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano. Literally ever scene has proven its purpose throughout the movie and every note of the soundtrack accompanies the emotional strenght of the film. ... Pure Brilliance !!!!!!	2
234	Showgirls	This lovingly ridiculous yet sincere trash satire is a glorious and jaw dropping fuck you to empty Hollywood films, placing all that is low brow on an huge glittery pedestal with eye popping colour and performances (especially from a deadpan Elizabeth Berkley who tears through the film like a wild animal in true Russ Meyer fashion). If you can't enjoy this film on any level that you must be one of the most boring people alive. Nomi Malone = GOD. 	2
235	The Adventures of Tintin	Really strikes the same atmosphere as the cartoons that I saw as a kid. That, mixed with the very nice Indiana Jones-scenes, lots of great details and the sublime technical features that comes with a Jackson & Spielberg partnership, this is all in all a brilliant film from start to finish.	2
236	There Will Be Blood	Excellent. P.T. Anderson has made his masterpiece and what may just end up being the greatest movie of this decade. It doesn't feel great at first, but after you walk out of the theater you realize that it has nestled a place into the dark recesses of your mind. 	2
237	Lost Highway	There are many aspects to this that will divide viewers, but one of Lynch's most abstract works behind INLAND EMPIRE has been stuck in my head ever since I first watched it. It has continued to compel me with its dark and surreal structure on another viewing, and its now one of David Lynch's best films for me.	2
238	Godzilla	Such a party animal. Dude gets drunk and just passes out in the middle of San Francisco then just walks it off.	1
239	Drive	This is as pretentious & boring a movie as you could wish to find. After an excellent opening scene that builds tension without a word spoken, that same ploy is used throughout the entire film; no one answers anyone without a lingering (minimum) 10 sec. pause and slo-mo face turn, and it just becomes TEDIOUS. The plot is plain stupid, the music annoyingly irrelevant and intrusive, the direction over stylized and awkward. Mulligan & Gosling do OK with what they are given, but I just didnt care	0
240	Ratatouille	So incredibly beautiful..everything! They remind us at the end with the Genuine Animation, no motion capture disclaimer, and it is damn beautiful animation!  This film definitely makes up for Cars which was targeted to a more blue collar audience, shall we say.  This is the complete opposite, made for artists, snobs, and generally people of passion and intelligence.  I LOVED IT!  No pop culture references or Sheryl Crow songs or dance sequences, just good characters, story, and animation	0
241	Barton Fink	I would call this movie an offbeat comedy that morphs into an intense psychological thriller but in truth it defies description.  John Goodman is great as always, as is pretty much everyone else.  I'm sure I don't fully 'understand' it yet after one viewing, but that doesn't matter.  Probably the Coens' best work, and that's saying a lot.	2
242	Requiem for a Dream	After seeing it a second time, I decided it's shit.	1
243	Interstellar	Another teeth-grinder from Nolan. The overwhelming cinematic experience mostly succeeds in hiding the many mistakes and scientific bullshit that Interstellar so blatantly throws at you. But after subsequent and thorough viewings, the outright arrogance with which this film was created becomes clear. Smothered with pseudo-science and philosophy, filled with false sentiment for the sake of cheap emotional involvement, and even boasting the occasional sensational action sequence. 	0
244	Taken	I guess they fucked with the wrong guy.	1
245	Logan	Logan disregards most superhero tropes, instead adopting motifs from film-noir and road trip movies, to create a film that is intense, gripping, and even emotional. The film does have some issues, namely villains that lack depth and most of the child mutants obeying the law of plot contrivance in the finale. That said, the soundtrack, the directorial choices, tone and gritty/real/bloody feel make this film enjoyable, though not necessarily rewatchable. A fitting send-off to Jackman's Wolverine.	0
246	The Martian	The wet dream of Elon Musk. Science saves the day. Matt, a scientist, conquers all but a few: managers and other non-stemmy folk who, in their non-stemmy non-awesomeness, pose a danger to the endeavour of science, and thus the salvation of the earth. And then Matt conquers them too. Hurray. 	1
247	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	I don't know what the fuzz is about. Abrams delivers the style of the old movies, which is pretty great. And Han Solo is as cool as he could be. But in the end it's just a well made fan film. Except for some decent new characters, Abrams brings in nothing new, it feels so redundant. And who cast Adam Driver for the role of Kylo Ren? And why? I expected a little more from Abrams. 	0
248	Pierrot le fou	An innovative film, yes.  Stylish, yes.  But it's also filled with pseudo-philosophical hipster nonsense that is so pretentious it nearly made me physically ill.  Bunuel is satisfied with leaving humorous paradoxes just that, Tarantino can reference his favorite artists nonstop without thinking it makes him a genius, but Godard insists on making everything revolutionary and life changing, and doesn't have the writing skill to pull it off.	1
249	I Spit on Your Grave	A hilarious fish-out-of-water story in which a New York writer learns the ways of humble country folk. Some wacky hijinks are bound to go down in this fun-filled adventure for the whole family.	2
250	Toy Story 4	I never thought I'd ever utter the phrase I would've liked to have seen more of the spork's existential anguish, but welp, here I am. It's probably the straight-up funniest film Pixar has made, and it's a testament to their strength as human story-tellers that even though I cried in the theatre, I felt disappointed because I know they can do even more. The weakest in the franchise by a slim margin, which is like calling Eyes Wide Shut the weakest Kubrick film: it's still a big accomplishment.	2
251	Mad Max: Fury Road	I once accidentally backed my dad's 1989 Honda Civic into a mailbox so most of this movie felt a little bland to me.	0
252	The World's End	With a superb cast and a great premise, this gets off to a flying start, with some great wisecracking dialogue. This could have been a really interesting examination of nostalgia, and a satire of the homogenisation of modern life, but instead we get lots of (admittedly witty) fights with very unscary and frankly boring robots. Someone needs to take away Wright's CGI budget because he's much better on a smaller scale. Disappointing. 	1
253	Arrival	Arrival is one of the most thought-provoking sci-fi films I've ever seen. The direction from Denis Villeneuve is ridiculously visually rich and very artistic with its long takes and steady shots. Amy Adams turns in the best performance of her career, and the way the film reveals her character's true nature in the third act is stellar. The design of the aliens and their language is beautiful, and I love the film's themes about language itself. 	2
254	American Beauty	White People Problems: The Movie	1
255	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Killing is wrong, I'm outta here! ...but wait, I'll just massacre everyone I know first. By no means is it as bad as episodes 1-3, but there's playing it safe and then there's being a talentless hack. The only scene I couldn't remember from the earlier movies was stormtroopers attending the Nuremberg Rally and throwing some Sieg Heils.	0
256	Pain & Gain	Just about everybody in this movie is good but the real standout is Dwayne Johnson who just ran with it and was awesome.	0
257	Irreversible	oh. my. god.	1
258	Grave of the Fireflies	Anyone who thinks animated films are for kids should sit through this and then re-submit their beliefs afterwards. It's unfathomable how they could adhere to their previous claim. This is one of the most haunting, devastating, and memorable films you will ever see. Few Americans think about what post-WWII Japan must have been like, and the hell that this film conveys is accurate and heartbreaking. The characters are real and deep, and the story tight. Flawless.	2
259	In Bruges	This movie is so great! It's funny, dark and entertaining. The cast is perfect, loved Fiennes and especially Farrell. Definitely going to watch this more often.	2
260	Harvey	Harvey is a flawless character (as also a flawless actor). As for Stewart, this might be his best performance. The film however... PLEASANT is the word I think.	2
261	Braveheart	God help those who don't love this film.  	1
262	Take Shelter	The film is often overpowering in its emotional impact, thanks in large part to Shannon's role as a truly tormented, heartwrenchingly fragile family man (and his wife, tormented by association, but sympathetic all the same, played wonderfully by Chastain), and to Nichols's pace which begins as a slow-burn, and continues to a finale which is nearly suffocating in its anxiety and subsequent catharsis. Phenomenal stuff.	2
263	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Another dumb, noisy, antagonistic action-flick from Michael Bay with the huge support of US Army. Thank God there is military to destroy non-negotiable terrorist-like Decepticons! Who Needs Autobots! I think Bay thinks like, if I shake the camera enough, and put enough fighting-robots into the story with dumb jokes, and shoot all those scenes in a rush so audience can never get anything and if I only focus on Megan's ass, who cares if I praise the army!  Did I miss sth? Was it Revenge of Bay? 	1
264	Man of Steel	Oh, Man Of Steel. I see that there once was a good movie hidden inside you. I see glimmers of creativity and storytelling that threaten to leak through. But this is not the reality. The reality is dull writing, an abysmal plot, and some of the worst cinematography I've seen in this decade. What we get is a man with no personality beating up space Hitler to a chorus of lens flares and monologues. For two and a half hours.	0
265	Life of Pi	I have never thought that the magical realism stuff will work well on big screen, but Ang Lee somehow managed to keep it magical. Visually it is stunning, especially if you are a big animal fan like me. I was expecting a corny story, but I really enjoyed its overall structure and the way it developed too. All in all, it was a really satisfying experience. And the first movie since Avatar maybe, that is really worth seeing in 3D.	2
266	Manos: The Hands of Fate	People say [name of movie] was the worst movie ever made, and then I reply, Was it in focus most of the time? and they say yeah, I guess, and then I say Then I've seen worse.	0
267	E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial	Great kids movies (Wizard of Oz, 7 Faces of Dr. Lao) show the inherent magic INSIDE ourselves; they celebrate the joy--and pain--of simply being alive and human. Manipulative drivel like E.T. show the magic coming from OUTSIDE ourselves. The film's message: a creepy looking alien from outer space will make your life worth living.  E.T. is the film for people who think winning the lottery will allow them to live happily ever after.	0
268	Only Yesterday	Reflection and introspection - and a look at our movements through age identities. Only Yesterday has a real sense of warmth and genuineness that makes it one of my favourite Ghibli features. Very balanced, subtle and careful with each of its characters and themes. Beautiful.	2
269	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Well I'm glad the force is awakening people and not putting them to sleep like the prequel films... this movie was a lot of fun. I won't say it's the best, because it is not. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is the best. Still, this sort-of remake of A New Hope was a lot of fun. I was really happy to see some old faces that weren't in the prequels and the new faces were really good...	0
270	Suicide Squad	The acting by Will Smith and Margot Robbie is the only good thing. The movie tries so hard to be edgy. The characters and story are bland and all over the place. Jared Leto overacts and oversells an already terrible over the top version of the joker. The villain is more absent in the movie than my father was in my life. Action scenes range from meh at best to I can't believe I miss Zach Snyder bad	0
271	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	I haven't seen a chase sequence take that long since the cops were tailing O.J. down the 405. The Resistance is the creative state of the franchise - running out of fuel, crawling forward when it should be blasting off, commandeered by people with different agendas who aren't in on each others plans, assailed by angsty man-children with gripes about the past. 	1
272	Inception	Chris Nolan is a genius, he creates a film that makes you think about just about everything imaginable. This film is so rich with action, with questions, but most of all it is rich because it is open to so many interpretations. This film will leave you breathless it will give you chills multiple times. The actors are so good words cant describe their performances. Leo just keeps getting better and better. JGL just seems to fit so nicely and Ellen Page is awesome like usual. Stellar film. 	2
273	The Silence of the Lambs	One of the best suspense thrillers of all time. Anthony Hopkins found the role he will always be connected with. But the movie is also important regarding the role of women in those kind of movies. Where they have been always the victim, they now, for the first time, get a leading role in the solving of that matter. A milestone in more than one aspect!	2
274	Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	"You loved Star Wars?  This is even better.  Dark and brooding, heavy heavy film compared to the first - and infinitly better.  This is Luke's movie.  Sure there's that Green Muppet, and Han gets to be an ice cube in Jabba's cocktail du jour, but those aren't bad things.  Lucas's ego swelled justifiably after this film.  Go watch now, I must...
"	2
275	Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets	visually amazing, however the script and casting are so mediocre that it ends up as a huge disappointment. who cast these moody teenagers with no chemistry??	1
276	Machete	I heard this movie described as the next Shawshank Redemption. I may have been the one who said that, but it doesn't make it any less true. Even though it's not true. Regardless of how true the first statement is, this is one bad ass movie.	0
277	Manos: The Hands of Fate	This is it.  This is really the worst movie ever made.  Watch it and be...bored.  Really bored.  I could drink three red bulls and be fast asleep watching this.	0
278	Avatar	DAMN YOU JAMES CAMERON! So here I was, getting comfy in my IMAX seat, putting my 3D-Glasses on, going over my assorted vocabulary of expletives to shred asunder what I fully expected to be yet another phony, pompous popcorn-flick (Hello Transformers 2!), just to be greeted with? A pretty decent movie! Yes, the story is shallow (gun-toting Cowboys, err, Marines battle the indigenous Indians, err, Aliens for their land), but done well. Take note Michael Bay! This is how you spend a AAAA-Budget!	1
279	Swiss Army Man	The last line of the movie (no spoilers) is what the fuck. It's not a question, it's a statement. And that sums up my feelings about this movie. How did it get made? Who read the screenplay and thought, yeah, we should go ahead and make this. But all that said, I was beyond entertained. It is absurd and surreal and an excellent foray into magical realism. But oh so bizarre. I might have hated it, but I think I loved it.	2
280	The Dark Knight Rises	If 'Dark Knight' was the Shakespeare and 'Godfather' of superhero films, then 'Rises' is the 'Les Miserables' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  As is Nolans custom the strength isn't necessarily in the parts (the plot and a few characters have some airholes) but in how they all fit together. Even the two previous movies seem stronger in light of this one. This may not be the Batman movie for everyone, but Nolan makes the finale that both his trilogy and his Caped Crusader needs, deserves and earned. 	2
281	The Martian	Christopher Nolan, I'm so sorry I ever doubted you. If this is the alternative, all is forgiven. I'll take half-baked philosophical pontificating over dialogue mostly consisting of unfunny quips any day; at least you know what the word tension means. Though to be fair to Ridley, this might not be much of a movie, but it is one hell of a book report. He summarised the shit outta that thing.	0
282	Prometheus	What a disappointment.  The biggest flaw in Prometheus is one of Alien's greatest achievements.  Alien is a movie about humans being human.  Everyone reacts to the events in a thoroughly natural and believable way.  In Prometheus I have no idea why anyone did anything or why they reacted in such ways.  If you want the biggest example of this compare how Vickers and Ripley handle their respective quarantine arguments and how the crew do or don't respond.	2
283	The Dark Knight Rises	I remember when comic book movies weren't so dour, and concerned with spinning self serious comic book allegories about revenge, the law and justice, like, you know, when they were fun.  When I see a summer blockbuster, great action is not negotiable.  Nolan doesn't have the patience or craftsmanship to build a great action scene.  The space is muddy, the whole thing ends up very abstract.  You know punches are being thrown, but there's no impact because you can't see what's happening.	1
284	Woman in the Dunes	I was in need of a shower immediately afterwards, to wash all the sand away.	0
285	La La Land	Only musical-dissenters and the very cynical will find themselves outcast by the film's overwhelmingly upbeat and joyous tone. They likely don't deserve such happiness anyway.	2
286	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Well cast.  The first third was right on the money for the most part.  The last two thirds were mixed for me.  Overall it was very entertaining with lots of action, some endless running about by small groups of extras on their way to somewhere important, some excellent pew pew, and an ending....well, that ending was something.  Go see it, it's worth a trip to the cinema.	2
287	300	Entertainment for kids, with muscle but no brain. 	0
288	Suicide Squad	"Will Smith saved this movie. Plain and simple. It was pretty much his usual schtick, but I was so relieved that they cut out so many of his awful one-liners from the trailers. Joel Kinnaman & Jared Leto were both awful. Really, it didn't seem like The Joker belonged in the movie AT ALL. 

This movie was like watching a (badly conceived) videogame. The plot was very straightforward. There was one mission and every now and then the action was broken up by some cutscenes and then game over."	0
289	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	While it runs the gamut from action-packed romp to shallow retread, it all amounts to a satisfying and reverent reboot with unprecedented potential. It's nice to see a modern Star Wars movie that has new characters with personality, a clear and basic story with grand scale, and genuine, intentional comedy. It probably rivals the original trilogy in its incredible sense of fun -- an important attribute that helps to differentiate itself from its painfully maudlin predecessors.	2
290	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	Was witnessing how the half of the audience left the premises of the hall after 20 mins of watching. Pity people are so adjusted to crashed cars, constant shooting and blowing of entire cities that they cannot react and perceive pure beauty by Alfredson, covered under super smart script, stunning performance and relentless connection to the reality.    	1
291	Fast Five	vroom pow kaboom the rock neeeeeeerrrrrrrr bang	1
292	The Matrix	Next to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, this is my all time favorite movie.  I refuse to let the second and third installments ruin this masterpiece for me.  I once watched it three times in one day.	0
293	2001: A Space Odyssey	In what was surely a practical joke by the director, the movie sprawls out over nearly 2.5 hours with nearly zero dialogue, characters or action. All too frequently I thought I was watching a photograph, so little was happening onscreen. Recommended only for ambiance, this is better considered as an art installment than a film. Though the segment involving HAL is good (though still poorly paced), comprising a bloated hour of hour of film wedged in the middle of 1.5 hours of watching paint dry.	0
294	Vicky Cristina Barcelona	Characters represent art's dissatisfaction (Cristina) and modern life's emptyness (Vicky) and of course madness of love (Maria Elena) with wonderful music and visual quality. I liked Allen this time.	2
295	Blade Runner 2049	Lacks the ambiguity that made the original great. There's never much mystery about what's going to happen, the dialogue is dull and must be mystifying to anyone unfamiliar with the first one, the characters' motivations are unengaging and the philosophizing is shallow. There's some great visuals and plenty of Sony product placement in case you forget who distributed the flick.	0
296	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Johnson's vision is smooth, chaotic, and original. His knack for universe-creation is put on full display here. That's probably why he's been given the power to control the franchise's path forward. The characters are interesting and fun. The story is thrilling. Go see this film.	2
297	Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe	Delivers.	2
298	War Horse	How disturbing is it that while men, just before climbing over the trench into nearly certain death likely take one last look at a memento of their wives and children, our main character looks at the sketch of a horse. 'War Horse' is filled with moments where people take stupid and unrealistic risks, routinely putting the life of a horse over an entire battalion. The film is so laden with forced and cheesy moments that if the horses began talking halfway through, it wouldn't feel out of place.	0
299	Ant-Man	I love the idea of a Marvel heist movie. The ants and technology of the suit are fun and make a nice fit into the MCU. The rest is strictly by the numbers Marvel formula with bland to stereotypical characters, particularly the villain, a predictable plot, but just enough good jokes and action. Why oh why oh why didn't they let Edgar Wright keep creative control?! Then this small time story really could have been huge!	2
300	The Fountain	A beautiful and melancholic look at life and death.  It is an amazing and heartwrenching tale and perhaps the best new film I've seen this year.  Hugh Jackman runs through the emotional wringer, doing a great job in his three roles.  Also, Clint Mansell's score is incredible.  I'll stop with the superlatives and just say see it.	2
301	Transformers	A supreme disappointment.  The movie felt like a 3 hour  GMC commercial.  The CG was blurry & overdone most of the time, though it looks very impressive at times.  As cool as flashing lights and big explosions are, it gave me a headache watching those fight scenes!  The sub-stories (the soldiers, and Sam's romance) add unnecessary time & character development, when the movie should have focused more on the robots.  The soundtrack and dialogue were bad too, but I wasn't expecting much anyway.	0
302	Sicario	Subtle acting, an unsettling score, and cinematography with incredible use of shadow made for a wonderfully tense, paranoiac atmosphere.  But if I'm being honest, I had no clue what the heck was going on from start to finish.	2
303	The Phantom Menace Review	Hahaha, really? This got added to the database? Well I surely do have a review to give you of this review. It's just down in my basement. If you go down there with me I'll show you.	2
304	Memento	Some say this film is based entirely on a bloody gimick. I cry bullshit! because without the film's twisted narrative, Nolan would not have the artistic license to explore the fascinating themes of memory and morality, and wrapping it around a neo-noir storyline. This is Guy Pearce's superior performance-he perfectly plays the angry everyman Lenny, who is forced to deal with a condition no one can understand, which only gives focus to the movie's twisted complexities. I have a strong desi	2
305	Pacific Rim	Not as good as I wanted, but better than I expected. It takes the Independence Day-style plot and does every part of it as well as that plot can possibly be done. Good acting, good ideas, with characters that push back against the roles they're supposed to be in - but still limited by the story structure they're working in. I enjoyed it, but I would have enjoyed it significantly more if it was just a bit less predictable.	2
306	Armageddon	A giant asteroid saves the earth from Bruce Willis!	1
307	Aliens	One of the few sequels that rivals the original.  This is the total package: comedy, action, suspense, horror, sci-fi, drama.  And it meshes so well.	2
308	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	'The Force Awakens' is a competent return to the Star Wars universe that thankfully surpasses the latest installments in nearly every regard, but out of fear of alienating a fanbase that had been wounded before, the film plays it too safe, relying heavily on iconic imagery, callbacks, and nearly the entire structure of 'A New Hope' to ease viewers back. While this makes for an acceptably fun romp, it also disappointingly means that the picture lacks enough personality of its own.	0
309	Drive	A conventional b-flick made with little artistry or skill and one of the most fake and pretentious films I've ever seen. First of all, it doesn't have a plot. Still, it wants to be considered a profound movie. Second, it has no acting. Gosling wears the same face no matter the scene and Mulligan thinks that staring into space is enough. There is some tension at certain points but it stems from the (inadequate) action and is rapidly eliminated by the ridiculous (and often slo-mo) dramatic scenes.	0
310	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A disappointing rehash with overwrought nostalgia. It manages to have a lightsaber fight worse than the original series! The General of the new order is awful with bad facial expressions. It uses death as a spectacle and rolls on quickly. Story is predictable with poor jokes and cringe-worthy lines. Relies on competent action but structure is loose. Not a fan of the story direction and Kylo Ren is lame. BB8 is probably the best thing about the film. What a waste.	0
311	Commando	Remember when I promised to rate you last? I lied. 	2
312	Enter the Void	After all that, after all the camera-freeing, it just wanders about on the ceiling. And when it isn't, its every movement is immediate. Direct. Noé goes to extreme lengths to carry the camera far away from its perch atop the tripod, and creates some breathtaking things for it to look at along the way, but that's ultimately all it does. It looks at things obviously or pointlessly. Simplistic, like its characters and plot. This is a high-concept arthouse film. It could have been so much better.	1
313	The Green Mile	The scene where they're about to put him on the electric chair and he says he's scared in the dark.. I cried like a baby there. That's one of the best and most emotional scenes in movie history. This movie is as close to perfection as one can be. I didn't like this movie, I loved it!	2
314	The Dark Tower	Wow! There are characters in this film with the exact same names as some of the characters in a really cool series of books by Stephen King. I wonder if these guys read those books... ever.	2
315	Bohemian Rhapsody	Enjoyable if formulaic biopic. 	2
316	District 9	Really kind of disappointed. As an action film, it definitely excels, and at least has an original concept. However, I desired much more of a social commentary and a stark message playing throughout by use of the realistic docudrama approach. Instead, the film seems to dissolve into an examination of what alien weapon kills people the coolest.	2
317	Over the Hedge	At only 83 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, making this a fast, funny, and sometimes even socially aware form of family entertainment, refreshingly adept despite its outward similarities to nearly every other 3D feature to have come out in the last year or two.	1
318	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	Emotionally revealing, almost pornographic, it's the definitive cinematic statement of love from a generation growing cynical to the concept of onscreen wooing per day.	2
319	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	I'm a bit disappointed. Whole thing seems to me like a mosaic of previous movies with sole intention of introducing new set of leads which will replace the old one. Sure there are some good points also, like H. Ford is badass as ever and D. Ridley is really good. On the other (dark) side, things are much worse. Bad guys are far less believable than in older movies.	0
320	Amadeus	Anyone with any humanity must see this film. Vastly underated. Lavish sets, some of the most beautiful of Mozart's work as a score and exquisitly filmed. Forget issues over historical accuracy they are not the point. Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham give masterpiece performances that are truly worthy of their subject matter. This film will shake your concept of Mozart, touch your heart and move you to tears in equal measures. - Genius!	2
321	8½	Whoever said this is a tornado of a film was absolutely right; there's so much to keep track of in every scene that it can get pretty confusing, but the more times you see it, the more layers you will unravel. And you will see it more than once. In fact, just writing about it makes me want to watch it again. There aren't many movies that carry that distinction.	2
322	The Big Short	The financial jargon and drama is thick and constant, but phenomenally and entertainingly packaged: The editing sizzles with both comedic and dramatic potency (lots of abrupt scene cuts and charming pop culture potpourri), the script is both serious and snicker-worthy (4th-wall breaks and snarky narration lie alongside tense moral exploration), and the big three put their acting chops on full display through some fantastic characters (the eccentric Michael, fiery Mark, and douche-y Jared).	2
323	Shoot 'Em Up	More over the top than Sylvester Stallone.	1
324	Shame	Well shot, and I loved how they didn't bother explaining everything like all other modern movies do.  But that said, nothing happened of note until it was too little too late.  A re-edit of this and maybe some more dialogue or impactful scenes would be better.	0
325	The Shawshank Redemption	One of the best ever made. Great ending to a great movie.	2
326	Isle of Dogs	Yule of Dogs as much as Isle of'd it	0
327	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	I was completely taken aback by that ending when I saw this-- the way it didn't seem to -mean- anything, just conveyed a strange beauty-- pure images, pure cinema. Just Leatherface spinning and swinging his chainsaw, like the two soldiers dancing at the end of Salò.	1
328	Fantasia	A masterpiece of artistic expression. There is no over-arching story to Fantasia and there doesn't need to be. Fantasia is all about the music; fitting, considering that the music is the central point of the film. Each segment in Fantasia could almost be viewed as an animated ballet: there is no speaking, only music and movement perfectly synchronized to create art. Fantasia is truly the most underrated Disney film. I'd probably go as far as to say that it's Walt Disney's masterpiece.	2
329	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	My favourite Spielberg. I find the ideas it explores fascinating (and very relevant) and the manner in which it explores them to be both highly compelling and incredibly affecting. It's a film that is not without flaws but personally I find so much rewarding about the film that the flaws can't really stop me from respecting and loving it. I adore the ending which is deceptively sentimental and remarkably dark, leaving David in the same situation Monica was in at the beginning.	2
330	Red Dawn	It's fun to laugh at just how precisely John Milius is like Walter Sobchak.	2
331	Captain America: The First Avenger	Not great, but I must admit that the character and storyline behind Steve Rogers becoming Captain America was fairly compelling. After the transformation, the writing, story and plot really seem to go down hill. FWIW, the Red Skull could have been an interesting villain (especially with Hugo Weaving in the role), but the writing involving the relationship and story between Captain America and the Red Skull wasn't so interesting.  	2
332	God Bless America	Dreadfully shallow, like some uncreative high schooler just watched Taxi Driver and decided to adapt it to their generation. Full of gratuitous rants that stoop to the level of pandering, it starts with a fantasy murder sequence and never rises above it for the rest of the movie. America's in a bad place not only because of those who are bashed in this movie but also due to folks like Goldthwait, who lower the level of social and political discourse to infantile depictions like this.	0
333	Pearl Harbor	Ugh. Awful and dumb. Its huge sets and stunt sequences are so poorly directed, all the awe is stripped from them. Bad.	0
334	Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	One of the first ever major blockbuster sequels to surpass its predecessor, and when your predecessor is Star Wars...	2
335	Pather Panchali	Every element of this film seems flawless.  Even the kid actors are perfect.  I gave it 100 because I was completely hypnotized by the movie.  More of a life experience rather than entertainment.	2
336	Burning	4 September 2018 & An accurate Murakami adaptation: You can't decide whether it's too deep or too superficial, just like books/stories of him. The best part of the film is the first half hour. Then the mystery its created, the paranoia of the character and the place where the director put the audience is definitely not for me.	0
337	Avengers: Infinity War	This movie deserves a high rating simply for not being a clusterfuck despite the crazy size of the main cast. The two and a half hours of the movie don't feel like a drag either. They found themselves an interesting villain and a decent plot, and ran with it to the point where it's more a Thanos movie than an Avengers movie (that's a good thing). A breath of fresh air in Marvel's cinematic universe (to be fair GotG 2 and Thor 3 recently were quite good). I'm very excited for next year's sequel.	0
338	2001: A Space Odyssey	Perhaps the most visually intriguing film ever, and a masterpiece of the kind that only Kubrick could deliver.	2
339	Alien	A Lovecraftian nightmare in space, Alien is the ultimate monster movie, H.R. Giger's design aesthetic lending itself well to the sublimation of psychosexual horror wrapped up tidily in a slasher film with dystopian post-Star Wars sci-fi trappings.  Everything about it is iconic.	1
340	Spotlight	VERY good movie. It was a little slower than I felt it needed to be in the beginning, but once they start investigating (which doesn't take too long), damn does it get intense. The subject matter (child molestation) might be a little much for some people to handle as the movie doesn't pull ANY punches, but it's better for it. Incredibly well-done on every level, and definitely a serious contender for Best Picture, come February.	1
341	Sorry to Bother You	SORRY TO BOTHER YOU is a messy and passionate allegorical freak-out. The strong central metaphor about the absurdity and inhumanity of capitalist conformity sees the film through its shakier bits, which start to pile up in the third act. It's almost impossible for a movie like this to resolve itself neatly--it's meant to raise questions, not answer them, and its greatest virtues are its authenticity and its unbridled sense of creative freedom.	0
342	Adaptation.	Kaufman does magic with his scripts. He leads movie-making into whole new territories. Amazing stuff.	2
343	Groundhog Day	The scene with the old homeless man gets to me everytime. I love the film for the fact that if I were stuck in such a position I'd probably do things the exact same way. The movie has so many levels to it, it's quite amazing. This is one of those comfort movies for me. 	2
344	Batman Forever	Used to be my favorite Batman movie, then I turned 14.	1
345	All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace	Another set of films that highlight how the crossroads of utopian solutions, oversimplification, misunderstanding, hubris, and ideology contribute to creating an unexamined foundational set of assumptions about civilization and humanity.	2
346	Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald	Beautiful to look at, but what a lousy script. Also, the characters lack the charm of the Harry Potter films.	0
347	What Dreams May Come	Psychobabble:  The Movie!  The writing is the kind of smug, sophomoric writing where EVERYTHING sounds like a cliché, even when it isn't (which is almost never), and the whole mess is capped by a New-Age retelling of the Orpheus legend, with an underworld populated by countless kvetching souls.  Robin Williams has two modes here: twinkly, calculated lovability and scrappy earnestness--it's impossible to say which one is more annoying. The whole thing is utterly nauseating.  	0
348	Spotlight	The screenplay is brutally honest, the performances are good, and the cinematography is on point. Still I can't help but think that the direction was a little safe and that more style would have really pushed everything over the top.	0
349	Lilo & Stitch	It's not often that you see a truly dysfunctional family in a Disney cartoon that feels believable. Tia Carrere does a great job in displaying her exasperation as Nani trying to raise the odd and troubled Lilo. Very enjoyable, and very different for Disney. Frankly, it's the first film in a long, long while for them that didn't feel lifted from somewhere.	2
350	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey	Whereas the LotR movies differed from the source material mostly by subtraction which made the plot sleek and efficient, The Hobbit is more addition - which slows the plot to a crawl. It seems the temptation of selling three movie tickets and three Blu-Rays won the war over good pacing.	2
351	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button	Benjamin Button is like a caricature of Stoicism. Yes, the movie is technically impressive, but in essence it is each eventless, brown-tinted episode after another for ever. The acting is pointless. The dialogue is terrible, but it is the voice-overs that make you suicidal. This is a movie for those who cannot get enough of (brown) sunsets, empty words and tormented Southern-accented voices. It is the opposite of life. I could not finish watching and excused myself at 2/3 of the film through.	0
352	Meet the Spartans	lol dis movie is funy. like wen evar dey made refrence 2 american idle or sumthing liek dat it made me laugh stuff and lol. i rly liked all the stuf wit carmen electra. she hawt!  But 4 realz, I actually tried to watch this and couldn't even get past the first five minutes. It is painful. PAINFUL!	0
353	The Predator	Flavourless action, tasteless humour (letting down a few decent jokes scattered throughout), and a plot without substance all contribute to an unpleasant dish. Neither schlock nor blockbuster action film, it was instead an empty mess of weak efforts.	0
354	Sorry to Bother You	I already dislike that this movie is going to be compared to Get Out & Spike Lee's early work. It's more than a story on race relations (which only comprise a few scenes). Tonally, it reminded me more of Mike Judge's Office Space (the opening),  Idiocracy (the fantastical and sci-fi tones), or a more fun Brazil. There are some great & timely discussions on humanity, the value of work, and how to use and abuse power. But it's also funny as hell. Especially Armie Hammer. Highly recommended. 	2
355	Four Lions	A comedy about British Muslim extremism? There's only one person who could pull it off: Chris Morris. His secret? Research. You cannot make a film like this - carefully negotiating a minefield of potential outrage while cracking jokes - without having learnt a lot on the subject and the people. The final act is the sobering conclusion to his research, the demystification of the mindset and motivation of people who have radicalised, how we react to them and Muslims at large. Also a crow explodes.	2
356	Gattaca	An unexpectedly realistic future movie. 	2
357	Shaun of the Dead	This film is definitely more of an homage to Romero's classic Zombie trilogy than a parody. It has romance, comedy, great one-liners and zombies! In my eyes there hasn't been a more entertaining british comedy since 'Life Of Brian'. The characters are interesting, the soundtrack is great and Nick Frost's 'Ed' just may well be one of the funniest sidekicks in British comedy history.	2
358	Twilight	If you're an angry twinker who hates his dad and wears garbage bags to school with black mascara, and skips on exams to meet the locals at the old IHOP for a 2pm triple blow in the Men's room, I'll like you better than this. I'll accept you into my home on Thanksgiving and ask you back for Christmas before I allow the son of a bitch who is responsible for this. This is unacceptable and needs to stop immediately. They're coming out with sequels for this shit, hopefully rapture gets us first. 	2
359	Road House	Yes, it's bad. But in a big, stupid, lovable way, like a labrador retriever that accidentally kills your grandmother.	0
360	Skyfall	Incredibly entertaining, action is top-notch and perhaps the best Bond opening sequence of all time. A bit more mature and darker than the other instalments. When put to paper the plot feels a bit weak but this didn't bother me during the viewing of this film, felt the film was a great experience.	0
361	The Secret in Their Eyes	Excellent. A rare feast that has all the right ingredients. This film successfully blends such a multitude of themes and emotions.. duty, decency, hate, revenge, friendship, unrequited love. Beautiful cinematography, amazing performances, flawless direction and production, an awe inspiring cinematic accomplishment. Very highly recommended.	2
362	Across the Universe	There were entertaining bits but for the most part it felt like that. Bits strung together by music. Music should be there to serve the movie, not the other way around. I like the ambition it just wasn't pulled off.	0
363	On Her Majesty's Secret Service	Other than Casino Royale, easily the most mature James Bond film. Bond, in a way that no other film (except the aforementioned Casino Royale) is characterized with depth and complexity, In this film, Bond is not simply 007, he is a human, which is always a breath of fresh air in an action film. Of course, the action is handled very well, especially in the last 30 minutes, but it is the depth that truly makes the movie. Too bad that George Lazenby is easily the weakest Bond to date. 	2
364	Godzilla	An expensive, but dull, remake of the first Godzilla movie, in which the monster is a baddie; unlike the Japanese original, the lizard king is here created by computer graphics; it is the remainder of the cast who seem to be played by men in rubber suits.	1
365	Logan	After 17 years and 8 X-Men films, Hugh Jackman and James Mangold gave audiences the best Wolverine story yet. The final tale of what is left of our beloved aging X-Men is a gritty and brutal one. Both Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are fantastic returning to their iconic roles. However, neither had ever been seen in such grim fashion. The most intimate film in the series is also the most visceral. The movie earns every bit of its R-rating, but uses it in service of the characters and story. 	2
366	Ex Machina	"This felt fresh after all the superhero films and sequels, and it's definitely one of the best scifi films of 2010's. Alicia Vikander is great as Ava and so is Oscar Isaac as the eccentric billionaire / IT guru Nathan. The film greatly utilizes its limited locations and contrasts the isolated
research facility with the breathtaking vistas outside.
My only real gripe is that the film should have ended 5 min earlier as the remaining scenes didn't add anything to the mix."	2
367	Interstellar	And in the news today,area man who was found hiding in the bookshelf of a young girl's room states that he got there by falling through a black hole whilst trying to save the human race.Next up,sports & the weather 	0
368	A Quiet Place	How do they fart?	0
369	Tucker & Dale vs Evil	Hilarious! Great comedy. It's like Scary Movie, but actually funny.. Too bad the movie changed from comedy into a thriller half way through, they should have kept up the comedy! This movie deserved a better last 20 minutes.	0
370	Raiders of the Lost Ark	This is probably one of the greatest adventure films ever.  It may even be the high water mark against which all other adventure films can be judged.  If you haven't seen this film, you're cheating yourself.	2
371	Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2	Marvel's take on Star Wars with the ship helmed by Captain Kirk. It has a great soundtrack, a strong supporting cast, and impressive visual effects which were quite colourful. The final action scene was quite reminiscent of an end of game boss battle. There are plenty of jokes and most of them land but at times jokes were made at the expense of a dramatic moment and undercuts the impact. Although still connected it feels tangential to the MCU. Overall it's great fun and as good as the first film	0
372	The Apartment	Starts off as a comedy and flawlessly slips into a drama. So many films try to make this transition and end up feeling like two separate films stuck together, but this one pulls it off with flying colors. Lemmon is fantastic.	2
373	Lawrence of Arabia	The wonderful cinematography of the desert, the excellent acting of O'Toole and Sharif in particular and the whole cast in general, the powerful score and the slow but tension-loaded pace turn this one into a masterpiece. If you can find a cinema which shows Lawrence you won't be bored for a second while watching this one for almost four hours. You will be stunned by the pictures and by the intensity of O'Toole's eyes while Lawrence's rises and falls.	2
374	The Room	It's like one of those late night Showcase softcore pornos except written by a space alien with no experience in actual day to day conversation who also happened to have a stroke that left him partially paralyzed.	0
375	Midnight in Paris	Midnight to Paris takes us to the Early 20th Century Zoo of Famous Artists. None of the artists we encounter are on screen for a meaningful amount of time, and their characterizations are cardboard stereotypes. It's a lame inside joke that quickly becomes tedious. It isn't totally intolerable, but do not expect anything more than a mediocre romantic comedy. I wish the inhabitants of the zoo escaped and turned this into a Jurassic Park scenario. Hemingway and Dali deserved better. 	0
376	Birdman	Starts out great (seems like a fitting double bill with Confessions Among Actresses) but then it tries to get specific and kind of loses its footing. The problem is not so much that the people are unlikable, but that they're unsavory in a mostly boring way. Seeing the tension between real life/stage life is exciting, but everything about Keaton is eyerollingly banal. Dad, you're a trending topic like ok we get it, old people hate smartphones. 	1
377	Captain Marvel	Both Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson are great in this film. The special effects are well done in this movie. There are some funny moments and some exciting ones. Overall I would recommend this film. 	2
378	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Weak, TFA is a masterpiece for this. But hey, at least porgs and ice dogs will be a good sell. Everything for the marketing. Woo-hoo :/	0
379	The Avengers	A competently made film elevated by some above-average performances and good action sequences. Direction and cinematography are very bland - they aren't interesting and serve as a medium to show baddies being punched, above all else. A thematic mess - plot points are raised and dropped, exposition seems to go against the action on-screen and there's no real unifying theme, just a mishmash of ideologies with no particular purpose. The action is well made but it feels like a lot of lost potential.	0
380	This Is England	Impressionable Shaun finds friends in the form of a gang of skinheads, who provide a motley and surprisingly compassionate contrast to the selfish, Thatcherist values of the time. Meadows's true intent, however, seems to be to show us that it's so easy to be sucked into attractive yet morally repugnant ideologies when we are at our nadirs, that [...] Cont'd: http://pwnt.co.uk/uploads/files/1/this-is-england.txt	1
381	Alien	So very creepy.  When I was a kid, I refused to see this movie because I thought it would be scary in a HOLY HELL CHESTBURSTER way, having seen that specific part once.  Watching it today, I realize that it's much more than that, scary in an Is it the goddamn cat again? way, and well-acted to boot.	2
382	Forrest Gump	Conservative claptrap in which a retard does what he is told by his superiors and bootstraps his way to immense wealth and success, while liberal peaceniks get AIDS and die. Fuck you, Robert Zemeckis.	1
383	Lady in the Water	A little piece of trivia: during filming, part of the set collapsed on Bob Balaban, trapping him underneath. When called over to help, M. Night Shyamalan proceeded to urinate in Balaban's mouth, while screaming how's THAT for a twist ending, bitch! over and over. It is included on the DVD's blooper reel.	1
384	Young Frankenstein	Funny and classic film. 	2
385	Repulsion	only a rapist could make such a boring film about rape	0
386	Oblivion	It's easy to draw comparisons between this and other Sci-Fi films, but the elements here come together in a unique way with a good soundtrack and a solid performance from Cruise. Doesn't push any boundaries, but is perfectly enjoyable for what it is.	2
387	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies	Have the producers learnt nothing from the book? The novel is about obsession with wealth driving people (or dragons) into madness. However, I doubt the production team had much more on their agenda than making a ton of money. The script is simply mediocre, including such original lines like You make me feel alive, and crazy new creatures such as bats especially bred for war! It's a forgettable ending for the trilogy.	0
388	The Day the Earth Stood Still	Great special effects, but lacklustre performances and dialogue make for a pretty wretched movie. Jaden Smith's character was so egregiously annoying and needlessly antagonistic that I gritted my teeth every time he opened his mouth. The environmentalism aspect of the plot was terribly shoehorned in, and it blew my mind that tenured astrobiologists and seasoned Secretaries of Defense didn't bother to parse Klaatu's sentences, or even ask him what he meant when he said he was here to save Earth.	1
389	Juno	Nothing special at all. Tries to be too hip and the main character is just a brat who thinks she knows everything.	0
390	Irreversible	An amazingly provocative meditation on the life-crushing ripples every act of violence has. I have never seen a more thematically complete, conscientious, & dedicated critique and denouncement of violence. With unique cinematography, incredible acting, & intense dedication, we are shown the ripple effects of violence in FULL. This movie will make you feel like your guts were ripped out w/ a scene of two caring lovers enjoying a beautiful moment. Violence is IRREVERSIBLE. Stop hurting each other.	2
391	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Star Wars is many things to many people, and most of them are right about it. To some it's all hinky spirituality. To others, it's laser fights and space freighters. Still others think of it as a love story or a Western or a galactic war zone. But it can also be a starting point to talk about courage, friendship, faith and family. (pluggedin.com)	2
392	The Mummy	A movie that finds a very good balance between action and comedy, while still remaining scary within it's boundaries. An exciting action film that is just fun to watch.	2
393	The Nightmare Before Christmas	One of the reasons why I love movies	2
394	Crash	WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE	1
395	Drive	80s courtesy of contemporary pop. Violence courtesy of torture porn. Moodiness courtesy of David Lynch. It's pop culture osmosis gone mad. Everyone likes it because they're afraid of real art.	0
396	Citizen Kane	You know what? It just might live up to its reputation. It's a masterpiece.	1
397	Blindness	I am either going to kill myself or the director of this movie.	0
398	Stranger Things	Stranger Things is what 'Super 8' wanted and failed to be, and more. Heavily inspired by Stephen King (who has since given his blessing on social media), but taking something from a number of 80s sources, ST plays more like an 8 hr film rather than a tv series. The kids acting and dialogue are both surprisingly strong and they carry the series wonderfully. While it may not be note perfect it's a thoroughly enjoyable binge watch for fans of 80s style supernatural mystery/horror.	2
399	Pocahontas	Rewatch. Hasn't aged particularly well, but, then again, neither have I. 	0
400	Sucker Punch	Starts out like a bad movie based on a comic book, and then becomes like a bad movie based on a computer game, filmed like an uninspired and endless music video. Then it makes it clear it is going to keep on doing this in the same way over and over again. Then I stopped watching.	0
401	The Evil Dead	Rough-edged but appealing performances and ridiculously exaggerated gore FX give this the pulpy feel of a horror comic book, and there's some especially invigorating camerwork.	2
402	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	Another totally uninspired Tim Burton CGI-fest with a truly bizarre(not in a good way) performance by Johnny Depp that manges to lose all the heart that the original had.	2
403	Ex Machina	 a favorite of mine from 2015...not a terribly original idea, however,  it is executed beautifully. a terrific finale that will keep you thinking...	2
404	The Fall	While yes, it's visually stunning and probably worth viewing on that merit alone, but the story just isn't there.  Some aspects of the story are intentionally not well thought out, that doesn't excuse it in my eyes.  It's so painfully obvious that Tarsem comes from music videos and commercials, this movie is all style and little to no substance.  Other movies that attempted similar feats and succeeded (to varying degrees) were Big Fish and Pan's Labyrinth.	0
405	Avengers: Infinity War	Thanos: the hand of fate. 	1
406	Lost in Translation	If Lost in Translation ended after the slow introductory shot of Scarlett Johanssen's scantily clad rear end, this movie would rate 100.  However, this movie continues on for two more hours lacking continuity within scenes, likable characters, a compelling plot or respectable pacing, showing why Sofia Coppola should be forced to change her last name before completely disgracing her father's legacy.  	1
407	Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close	This is both overrated and underrated. It doesn't deserve a best picture nomination, I think most people agree with that, but it also doesn't deserve all the backlash it's getting because it got nominated. It's a fine film, though a bit manipulative. I went with it for the most part, but there were a few parts that went a bit too far and became a bit unbelievable, like the self mutilation and the mom following him. The kid is great, Tom Hanks is just Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock isn't that great.	2
408	Donnie Darko	Mom, i wanna be David Lynch!	0
409	We Need to Talk About Kevin	Not even the flawless Tilda Swinton could make me believe this contrived, self-satisfied piece of exploitation disguised as an art film. Everything is unmotivated here: The psycho son, the clueless, one-dimensional dad who seems not to have a job, the cardboard daughter, even the inexplicable soundtrack. The irony here is all in the title: They never do. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha. No, we need to talk about the script.	0
410	A Serbian Film	Pathetic attempt to scandalize - might be shocking if this is your first movie, but if you are already dulled by other crappy films, it's mostly boring, ludicrous and too comical to have any impact.	0
411	Carnival of Souls	This legendary indie classic may represent the ultimate triumph of talent and care over budgetary constraints. The film works both as a straight-ahead horror outing in an understated but genuinely eerie Val Lewton vein and as a dramatization of a mental breakdown. Harvey contrasts the determinedly mundane world of Mary's daily life with the haunting nocturnal images of a pier-front pavilion where the title specters perform a nightly danse macabre	2
412	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Unlike any film I've ever seen, in a great way. So many of the jokes hit perfectly, and I have a feeling I missed a bunch of them. Wish I would've seen it on the big screen.	0
413	Dancer in the Dark	I despise the cheap way von Trier tries to manipulate the audience. Watching Dancer in the Dark is like watching a film where a cute little bunny is being slowly and painfully dissected alive. I felt almost as if the director himself was standing behind me in the cinema and yelling Cry! Cry! This is sad! I refused to be manipulated that way - and hated the film.	0
414	Now You See Me	Starts off promisingly enough with the introduction of the group of tricksters soon to be known as the Four Horsemen and the intriguing premise of using magic as a cover for actual crimes. However, the script violates some of the cardinal rules of storytelling by keeping its most interesting characters (the Horsemen) off screen most of the time and leaning less on true misdirection in favor of directly lying to the audience. This saps a lot of fun out of the mystery and subsequent reveal. 	2
415	Transformers	If I were five and I had never seen a movie before this would be awesome, but unfortunately I'm an adult.	0
416	Forrest Gump	The problem about this kind of movie is the I need  desperately to get the Oscar! feeling all over the place.	0
417	Avengers: Infinity War	It's difficult to put into words the massive, gigantic achievement this movie is and represents. That the Russos managed to tell a coherent and gripping story while juggling such a humongous cast, and still paying good service to every character (although some more than others) cannot be understated. Thor in particular continues his streak from Ragnarok and is now firmly my favorite character in this franchise. Don't go to the bathroom for this one, every single scene is key.	2
418	(500) Days of Summer	You look back on a failed relationship, and the memories start from the beginning. You remember the meet-cute, the awkward courtship, the silly, sexy first kiss. But memories don't always finish out in a linear fashion. Before long you juxtapose your best moments with your worst. The time your joke killed and the time it died. Listen, that's life. You can't annotate something both so simple and complex: sometimes you get together, sometimes you break up, and sometimes you misread The Graduate.	0
419	The Thin Red Line	This film is long, contemplative and is probably the most beautiful war film ever shot.  The violence has a  balletic flair.  Some of the best battle sequences on film can be found here; you can really feel the fear the soldiers' faces at every moment.  	2
420	Deadpool	I didn't like Deadpool at all. The humor, the characters, the screenplay/narrative, the cinematography - it all fell flat. There's a couple clever and funny moments and the action scenes aren't cluttered with fast cuts and shaky camerawork, but for a film obsessed with commenting on cliches, Deadpool is a terribly conventional film. 	0
421	Dallas Buyers Club	Both McConaughey and Leto give good performances and there are some really hauting scenes here, but I'm torn because of the tone the film takes toward the FDA. According to this, the FDA are murderers and AZT might as well have been cyanide. As a biologist, I will tell you that AZT was one of the first drugs that was effective at treating HIV  and many people lived longer or survived because of it. Yes there may have been alternatives, but demonizing things isn't a good way to prove a point. 	0
422	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1	This was a bit of a snooze-fest to be honest. It was over-wrought, over-long and very sparse. I left the cinema asking, what happened in the last 150 minutes? We found out very little, and saw very little of what might happen. The theme of growing up as an innocent child in a world of darkness was lost in the din of nothingness. The action scenes were poorly programmed to my view, and I was very disappointed in this respect. Somewhere in this mess something positive lurks but where I know not.	0
423	Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief	We were so fucking stupid- every interviewee.	0
424	The Mist	The monsters on the outside aren't the scary ones.  It's the ones on the inside.  Awesome ending as well as it doesn't bow down to a typical Hollywood ending.	0
425	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	Have never left a movie feeling like I did upon walking out of the theater that night. Magical movie. The best of my youth	0
426	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon	Asian movies where the people point to the next roof and fly there without any explanation are not my kind of movies.	0
427	Fantasia	Extraordinary animated feature marks one of the high points of Disney's achievements in theatrical films. The best of the seven sequences are Night on Bald Mountain and The Sorcerer's Apprentice (starring Mickey Mouse!), but all of them have achieved a classic reputation.	2
428	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Given the opportunity to form a duumvirate that would balance the badness of the bad guy, the clueless millennial throws everything down the drain for another round of deadly galactic hide-and-seek	0
429	Us	Quite boring. It's a lesser episode of some budget sci-fi / horror anthology show from the 1990s, except that show would never have allowed such an incoherent mess of a story to be shot, let alone make it to broadcast. Lupita does good acting, of course, and there are a handful of Hah, that was amusing moments, so that's nice. It's not scary. Will you all get over Jordan Peele now, please?	0
430	Drive	Now this was refreshing! Dialogue is limited, instead you get exageratted stares from Gosling and Mulligan that somehow seem to drive the characters better than many blockbusters coming out now days. The soundtrack was incredible with a dark brooding type cinematography. Perfect setting. Ryan Gosling plays the ultimate badass and it doesn't seem to matter that he doesn't even have a backstory. Just a nameless Clint Eastwood hero full of Paul Newman and James Dean. Refn nailed this one!	2
431	3 Idiots	You're pulled along by a great tear-jerkin' buddy story with fantastic characters all around, meet a few snags of Bollywood cheese, and realize you just watched a pretty fearsome unschooling movie.	2
432	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	The whole movie felt like it was made out of some warmed up ingredients of the original trilogy. All the points go to Ridley and Boyega. I hated the humor for the most part and the script was bad.	0
433	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug	Without having read the book, an therefore having no clue to what the last installment will unfold, this movie have confirmed my thougts, on how this adventure survives us critical viewers. I really don't believe this story would have won our hearts, had it not been for the LOTR movies. Thank God for giving us those, because I am truly in love with this universe. This movie is more entertaining than the first one, and has more depth in almost every aspect. - Very Good.	2
434	Spirited Away	The more I watch this, the more I am blown away by it. This is possibly the most imaginative children's animation film ever made. Miyazaki's success lies in his unmatched ability to deliver messages that are abstract, yet so powerful and visually engaging that the concepts settle firmly into one's sub-conscious. It really leaves the viewer to take the ideas with them, and that is the essence of a powerful movie.	2
435	What the #$*! Do We Know?!	I feel like my mind was just viciously and mercilessly violated. I need a shower.	0
436	Inglourious Basterds	Such a great film. The tension throughout this film was really amazing. There were more than a few moments throughout this film where I was holding my breath waiting for the tension to break and the scene to literally snap into action. I was surprised that the title characters weren't the most interesting, that spot is left for Christopher Waltz's character. If you have no interest in this film I think you still should see it for his performance.	0
437	The Way of the Dragon	It's all about Bruce. Dude is amazing to watch. As a movie, it's pretty stupid.	2
438	Sicario	The man knows how to build tension. Combination of the sweeping scenery, the menacing bass line music and the tight edits, it gets so tense you have to hold your breath. He also knows how to draw amazing performances and there's no better in this than Benicio. The story didn't exactly blow me away but as a film, it's terrific.	2
439	Half Nelson	Gosling's best performance with a charming cinematography in a very smart story..	2
440	Captain Marvel	One of the better Marvel origins,avoids nearly all the tropes and pitfalls.  Nice to see them do a female hero without constant butt shots,and make her Thor level.I love Avengers,and am glad it won't be a total sausage fest moving forward. Still mid tier overall,but a success in my book	0
441	Troll 2	So bad that it went right past so bad it's good and just became bad again.	0
442	Inglourious Basterds	This may be the most important Holocaust film of this decade. Especially as a Jewish girl I should know that this category is so filled with fake pathos, that it became so rare to find a truly innovative film that deals with this issue. But I must say - this is NOT a film about the actual Holocaust. This is a film about Holocaust films, and the poorly-made emotion-exploitation that Holocaust film has become a synonym to. I salute Tarantino for putting this big illusion out of it's misery	0
443	Bubba Ho-Tep	Great performances by Campbell and Davis. Amusing film.	2
444	The Iron Lady	Weak star-vehicle checklisting the british prime minister's most famous historical passages with hardly any insight. Should be noted for turning an intriguing and hugely dividing political story and subject into soporific blandness. 	0
445	Sorry to Bother You	Really heavyhanded but just an incredibly entertaining story and film	2
446	Drive	A truly awesome movie. Beautiful cinematography, breathtaking violence, impressive simplicity, and genius, subtle style. Favorite movie of 2011 so far.	2
447	The Imitation Game	there was not a sliver of innovation or authenticity anywhere in this film. yes, the actors were good, yes the cinematographer was skilled at making shots, yes the dialogue was punchy and witty at times, but there was nothing being said or felt. it went the most banal, hollywood route, right down to the overbearing music that beats you over the head with the emotionality of the scene. the imitation game is, alas, an imitation of tropes played out too often in the past. in a word, stale.	0
448	Juno	Getting preggers at a very young age is apparently ok if you're into cool things. 	1
449	Akira	The animations are good, and the first part of the movie with motorcycle gangs rampaging through a worn down city is both beautiful and promising. Sadly, the movie doesn't live up to those promises. After a while, it takes a turn for the worse with psychic kids and murderous toys. I suppose it's a mater of taste, but I didn't appreciate it. The final scene saves the movie from being just mediocre, but still... I suppose my expectations might have been to high, but I'm a bit disappointed.	0
450	Hotel Chevalier	I really hate this short-crap for its blatant misogyny. Nothing is safe from Anderson's indie-o-matic, so watch out otherwise you might be subjected to horrible indie rock sequences with corny face-off dialogues. 	0
451	Blade Runner 2049	*RR* Whether it be my general distaste for the original, or my disposition on the particular night I saw it, my initial reaction to Blade Runner 2049 was not a positive one, to say the least. But now, with the benefit of having the first film fresh in my mind, I can safely say that 2049 is not just a good film, but a great one, a movie with a great many observations on what it means to be human, told through spellbinding visuals, a haunting score, and stellar performances.	2
452	Birdman	This movie wasn't afraid to be weird while at the same time mirroring reality and I loved that. It's really a 21st century Sunset Blvd. with a fallen actor trying to grasp for any semblance of relevance. The manner in which it's filmed with the extremely long takes and collectively great performances ensure that this movie will be long remembered. I wish more movies were this ambitious. 	2
453	Reptilicus	Possibly the only monster movie to have a mid-film interruption by the Danish Tourism Board.	1
454	The Core	OK, we're going to give the vessel six components - one for each of you to work in - and continually destroy whichever component is at the end when it becomes necessary to the plot to kill someone off. Sounds good. Can I work in the front part? No. Dammit.	2
455	It's Kind of a Funny Story	If you liked this you've never been in a mental institution. No movie made me want to die more than this one.	0
456	The Room	Tommy Wiseau is an alien send to this planet to impersonate and study human beings. He doesn't really understand us yet, but this is his interim report.	0
457	Batman & Robin	Guest Reviewer Mr. Freeze: Thees feelm put the Batman franchise ON ICE for nearly a decade because of ze COLD reception! BAHAHAHAHA	0
458	Home Alone 2: Lost in New York	Cut me a break. They lost the kid again? And the Wet Bandits just so happen to wind up in the same city? Even as a 10 year old, this was ridiculous. 	0
459	Hellboy	I don't fully shit on movies too often, so this one needs be made an example of. We are not getting the third Del Toro Hellboy movie for this? THIS? The facial prosthetics for Harbour looked plastic. Sarcasm doesn't work if every character in the movie is using it! NONE of these quips or one liners hit home. The theater was dead silent. The monsters were uninspired and generic wannabe del toro cgi trash. Their hint at a sequel was the first time I laughed. Actor choices were also awful. F-	0
460	Blade Runner 2049	If you were to really try and unpack the plot, I think most would agree that there is not a lot to it, it isn't particularly creative, and is extended way beyond a runtime that can be considered appropriate. But the film is seductive, and one of intense aesthetic design. I think what I'm trying to say is I didn't know you could polish a turd so brightly.	2
461	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	I was in love with this movie from the opening credits. My first thought was, Yes! Thank God I have three more hours to go!!!	2
462	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	Ripping good Sci-Fi yarn, but hard to watch at times because of Chewie's stream of splenetic profanities and vitriolic racism. Maybe that shit flies on Kashyyyk, but tolerance and civility is the byword in these parts. Also, take an engineering course to compliment your technique of hitting shit till it works.	2
463	2001: A Space Odyssey	Utterly exhausting. Although it holds a fairly interesting concept, staying awake is almost too great of a challenge.	0
464	Knowing	Dark, dreary, sci-fi, quasi-religious, peri-apocalyptic pabulum is so bad, you will wish for the world to end rather than endure another painful minute. Various aspects make this flick laughable, including Cage, as usual, taking himself way too seriously and the movie opening with a flaming moose running in slow motion (seriously).	2
465	Holy Motors	Every reviewer is going to tell you the same thing. First they'll tell you it's bizarre, strange, madcap. Then they'll say, What does it mean? A commentary on the advance of digital technology? On what it means to be an actor? On reincarnation and religion? Then they're going to say Denis Lavant was great. Unrecognizable in every scene delivering ~10 performances in two hours. Then they're going to tell you if they thought it was brilliant. Well... it is. Amazing. Score is not a grade.	2
466	The Thing	Carpenter's shape-shifting alien feature is a masterwork of pacing, creating the tensest of atmospheres and ramping up the paranoia with every passing scene. The cast, notably Russell, are on top form, and the breathtaking practical effects are comfortably the most impressive ever put to film. Throw in a perfect ending and what's left is without doubt the greatest achievement in horror cinema.	2
467	The Favourite	A delightfully mean period comedy about power struggles at the royal court. All three leading ladies (and also Nicholas Hoult) are perfectly cast, and Lanthimos' unique style of filming gives the movie a very particular look.	2
468	Interstellar	Considering this a movie from Christopher Nolan I expected so much more. It is a scifi movie, and I am willing to accept the science of this movie. Nolan tried way to hard to create way too many twists and long dramatic speeches backed by voodoo science. Finally, the last nail in the coffin what doesnt make sense is explained by  all powerful love. The movie gets a higher rating than what it deserves because of the visual effects. The movie is just way too long. The worst Nolan movie.	1
469	The Wrestler	Mickey Rourke makes an awesome performance, truly deserves his nomination from the Academy. And he fits perfectly for the role. That, with the great screenplay and the amazing Aronofsky, who brought us The Fountain, makes for an astonishing film! Definitely a must-see!	2
470	Dances with Wolves	"I can watch this one over, and over, again! I don't find anything wrong with this movie. It deserved every award it garnered. Just fantastic story-telling, incredible visuals,
 sumptuous score, and spot-on casting. One of the most moving films ever made, in my opinion."	2
471	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey	How do you adapt a 400 page book into a trilogy? by padding it out with all the unnecessary back stories, flash backs and references to LOTR that you can. The acting was fine, the look was pretty nice, but it was just an overlong introduction to two hopefully, much better films. Avoid it and wait for the obligatory 'extended edition' if you really want to see it again. I won't. If anything, its made me appreuciate the other trilogy more.	1
472	Maleficent	My review is a bit biased because I fell asleep during the movie.  I imagine this was meant for kids.  That is code for this movie was not very good.  Production values are off the chart though.	0
473	Spring Breakers	Terrence Malick on bath salts. I'm speechless.	1
474	The Last Airbender	The single worst big-budget blockbuster since Batman and Robin. No filmmaker has ever destroyed such great material so thoroughly and effectively as Mr. Shyamalan has here.	2
475	Ratatouille	I was skeptical about this film up until after about 1 minute into it, by which time I'd developed the distinct feeling that this film would be something truly excellent. I was relieved at the end to acknowledge that my first impressions were accurate. I don't remember the last animated film that worked for me as well this one, with its undeniable charm (in all categories). However, I am not in the film's target age group. I don't think the younger generations would be equally impressed.	1
476	Being John Malkovich	After 15 minutes inside me, you'd probably just end up with child support payments.	1
477	A Quiet Place	Having constant scary music and jump-scares in quiet scenes actually hurts the premise of this movie. Characters were making dumb choices non-stop that even under my suspension of disbelief was crossing the line. The logic behind what the monsters can and can't hear constantly changes. Overall, a fantastic premise hurt by sticking to clichéd Hollywood Horror movie tropes and a soundtrack that doesn't know when to stay quiet. Maybe it would have actually worked better without a soundtrack.	0
478	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	2 hours of boring setup for a wetfart anti-climax of a finale but it's not nearly as dull/obnoxious as Man of Steel so I guess that's a plus? This version of Superman is a boring hypocrite idiot and terrible at being Superman. Affleck's Batman might be an incredibly violent murderer but he's by far the best thing in this shitfest. And hey let's shoehorn Wonder Women in there because we want to soil the souls of the unfortunate moviegoers with this Justice League excrement as soon as we can. 	1
479	Monster A Go-Go	A foam peanut of a movie.	1
480	The Night of the Hunter	I realize Robert Mitchum is supposed to be some bad-assed freaky preacher...instead he hams it up, way over the top, in almost every scene he's in. I hate nearly every part of this movie. It's movies like this turd, a movie that has been stuck on a best movies made list for far too many years, that makes me hate old, has-been critics that are anything but current. 	0
481	Godzilla	The human element is far more stressed in this film than in all the others, and while it struggles to be interesting as it follows its protagonist and blue-balls you with repeated teasings of kaiju combat, when the monsters or characters shine, they shine with a high-intensity nuclear sheen. Mixed with a strong cast, excellent sound design and cinematography, and a respectful homaging tone, the King of the Monster's re-eruption onto cinema is triumphant and awesome.	2
482	Mac and Me	ALF mixed with E.T. mixed with vomit and my own tears.	1
483	Sin City	Awesome characters, brutal and simple stories, and probably the coolest looking film I've ever seen	2
484	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	Terrifying and hilarious movie about our world at the brink of destruction due to the arrogance, incompetence and just plain madness of man. Tons of great dialog with Peter Sellers in THREE great roles. Excellent set design by Ken Adam who went on to become famous with his work on the James Bond movies. George C. Scott delivering a great performance as Curtis LeMay, pardon, Buck Turgidson. And what a weird and wonderful choice to make Slim Pickens the commander of the bomber. Ah, good times.	2
485	Payback	pretty funny, full of clichés (good guy, bad guy ... who'll win ?!), some nice explosions, not a movie to watch ten times but once or twice is fine :-)	2
486	The Boondock Saints	Worthless infantile pap for 16-year old boys. Imagine Tarantino with no balls, no awareness of other movies, and no budget, operating on the assumption that he's Ingmar Bergman.	0
487	My Name Is Bruce	If you're a Bruce Campbell fan - I mean a REAL BC fan - you will get an absolute kick out of this send-up of his celebrity, his uber-fans and the film industry in general.  Lots of inside jokes that non-Bruce fans just won't get.	2
488	Joker	A masterful performance by Joaquin Phoenix isn't quite enough to prop up a script that feels like it's telling a story that doesn't belong in the universe it's being told in.  It feels like it wants to be thought-provoking, but I'm not sure it works on that level.  Watch it for Phoenix -- he will win awards for this -- but don't expect to have your mind blown.	2
489	The King's Speech	Each scene in The King's Speech is so poorly staged that its ineptitude sometimes borders on the avant-garde.	0
490	The Exterminating Angel	The trapped atmosphere and the satire on the bourgeoisie make this both a horrifying picture of humans at their worst and a comedic take on the idea if the bourgeoisie were separated from the rest of society and trapped in their own tiny limited world. Buñuel utilizes one set for the main part of the film in a similar manner of Hitchcock's Rope but that set is used for a symbolic purpose instead of keeping suspense in one trapped environment. 	2
491	Up	In my opinion this is the best movie that Pixar has yet to put out.  The animation is awesome, but the storyline is even better.  The interaction between the Carl and Russell provides lots of laughs (especially when you then throw in a dog and some sort of crazy bird).   My date went through an entire box of tissues, so if you cry come prepared.  But besides all the laughs and tears (that Pixar films usually have) this really had a deep story to it.  That's what I liked best about it. Love Dog!	2
492	Fury	Ayer's obsessions with gangs, brotherly bonding and masculine seduction are at the fore. All of Pitt's acting comes from the scar on his face, but he does a good job strutting around like a warlord. Less a story about how War Is Hell and more about how war is something men do to boys. More Training Day than End Of Watch.	1
493	The Wizard of Oz	An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant. A must-see film for young and old.	2
494	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Shut up, losers. It was good. 	0
495	The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water	Lacks the wittiness and charm of the first, but still enjoyable. 	2
496	Nightcrawler	The superhero origin problem taken to an extreme. Here, we don't even see Jake Gyllenhaal become Nightcrawler, it's just about his job before he became a blue teleporting monster. Not even a cameo by Mystique! 	1
497	American Psycho	Chris Bale's amazing acting propels brilliantly timed comedy through a movie which uses violence, excess and gore to make fascinating points about male vanity and the nature of sanity. It's not just a frightening look at a killer or a hilarious farce about a madman but also a statement about our own minds, fears and desires. Magnificent film indeed!	2
498	Toy Story	I can't tell how many times I watched it as a child and how much I enjoyed it. I like everything about it, characters, design, story, conflicts... I just love this movie and the full concept. And if I also think this was just the commercial beginning of the best animation studio (in my opinion) ever, followed by many other great projects and a new way into animation both technically and storytelling... Just, thanks Pixar for making these movies and bringing this movie and saga to life.	2
499	Interstellar	just hate Nolan; or Nolan-lovers should I say! constant bombardment of science humbug (correspondence to theory is not the point). contrast it with the silence of 2001! You science-geniuses all needed this information overload to accept a not-even average story as a cinematic masterpiece. How I hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside Battlefield Earth or Armageddon etc, when the Nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade away	0
500	Inland Empire	Lynch paying tribute to himself. His technique, mastery in conveying emotions by camerawork and music, as well as his skill in interwining different planes of the story  are to be admired. However, three hours of psychodelic images forming a riddle seemingly without - unlike 'Mullholland Drive' - a solution was just too much for me and the admiration become boredom at the end.	2
501	The Thing	The quintessential horror film.  Great story, great cast, flawless execution.  John Carpenter and Kurt Russell at their finest.	2
502	Hereditary	Half family drama that get you to get into the characters, half horror of the ordinary kind that get you scared. But since you care about the characters, you ARE scared. Also, acting on the level not usually seen in horror movies. 	2
503	Ex Machina	A familiar subject among sci-fi fans done nicely with good effects and acting but inconsistent characters and too easy plot tricks (blackouts). People say it's a twist but is not, not because the genius who creates the A.I. is an easy going millionaire drunk bearded man living in the middle of nowhere means it has a twist on the A.I. subject, but it does makes the film more enjoyable to watch	2
504	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Episode VII may have just taken the spot as my favorite Star Wars movie. It exceeded all of my expectations and then some. Well written, great story, awesome new characters, and superb acting all around. Daisy Ridley & John Boyega were hands down the perfect casting choices. Even BB8 was a joy to watch. This is not only the Star Wars movie that fans wanted, it's the Star Wars movie that fans needed.	2
505	Monsters	An excellent premise and stunning scenes of a war torn part of the world mean precious little when the titular Monsters are in the film for all of 10 minutes at most, with the rest of the screentime devoted to tedious travel arrangements and a tepid romance between two dull charmless characters.	0
506	4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days	Why so many people love this movie, I'll never understand. To me this is just an exploitation film (and I do use the term loosely) that plays on the sensitivities of mostly foreign movie 'connoisseurs' that think sordid, bleak stories set in unfamiliar, but 'harshly realistic' locations is somehow synonymous with great cinematography. It's not 'realism' and it's not great, it's just giving your audience what they expect and want to see. I ain't jumping on this bandwagon.	2
507	The Grey	Truly a movie of the fray, wading between being an okay film and an absolute atrocity. It's a character study, without any study. The atmosphere and attempted nihilistic attitude set up such a strong metaphorical theme that is torn down piece by piece by the cringe-worthy dialogue, awkward pacing, and cornball emotional outbursts.  The wolves not only look terrible, but behave in such an illogical manner that they might as well have been designed by J.J Abrams. Oh and then there's the ending.	0
508	Jurassic World	Military is bad, family is important, dinosaurs are people too.	0
509	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Awesome all around and damn Wonder Woman is a bad ass.	2
510	Psycho	I love this movie!!!....In my humble opinion Hitchcock's true masterpiece....I envy anyone who's seeing this for the first time	2
511	Hereditary	Wow! What a great performance by Toni Colette. This was a great movie with some original elements. It was a creepy atmosphere throughout the movie, but not many scares.  The ending was a bit suprising, but good!	2
512	The Proposal	Funny ? Yes. Charming ? Yes. Predictable ? Yes. But did it bother me it was predictable ? No. The Proposal actually is a good movie , and delivers everthing you want in a Romantic Comedy. I'm a fan of Ryan Reynolds , and Sandra Bullock does a good job. But what really makes this movie better then other movies is it's great supporting cast with Betty White and Oscar Nunez (Ramone) who are both funny as hell. 	2
513	Calvaire	Du Welz coalesces horror upon horror until this somewhat arguably surreal fable peaks in a sequence so alarming and morbidly engrossing that even Tobe Hooper would put his fingers over his eyes. It doesn't alleviate anything that cinematographer Benoit Debie is so excellent at depicting the churning, whirling insanity. Repulsive, sordid, unhinged, du Welz's bizarre, forceful gut-wrencher is an uneasy tumble into insanity.	2
514	Avatar	Okay: I kind of liked the idea of this, but it was a freaking cliché parade. I know better ways to portray both good and bad guys as the one used in this movie. It all has some great potential that is wasted. But despite everything, it did keep me entertained. Oh, and please, no sequel!	2
515	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Woow! What a temperate work from Gareth Edwards. And it is better than Force Awakens.	0
516	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Summer films drop to a new low in Transformers 2. Michael Bay's action opus barely contains a plot, takes a dozen or so diversions that serve no purpose and help extend the running time to an insufferable 2.5 hours. In addition, the cinematography and character design combine to make even giant robot battles boring and confusing. Toss in some of the most racially sensitive comic relief since Jar Jar Binks and you've got a big, bloated mess.	0
517	(500) Days of Summer	Definitely my favorite romantic comedy, which is probably not too hard because I loathe the genre. Is it really one, then? 500 Days Of Summer doesn't seem to try too hard in that regard. It feels more like a movie about love and appropriately realistic at that. I've gotten alot of shit for hyping this movie after I've seen it but instead of burying it as a guilty pleasure, let me shout if from the rooftops: AWESOME. FUCKING. MOVIE.	0
518	Lost in Translation	I really couldn't pick a single flaw in this. Beautifully shot, perfectly acted and has an atmosphere unlike any other. One of those rare films that feel like a gift. 	2
519	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	J.J. Abrams is given $200 million and decides to modernize A New Hope. Unfortunately, it's in the same continuity, meaning a lot of main plot points don't actually make sense. Somewhat of a competent action film, at least, but just too frustratingly similar.	0
520	Terminator: Dark Fate	I heard about a Terminator 2 screening that turned out to be a surprise screening of Dark Fate. I wish my Dark Fate screening had been a surprise screening of Terminator 2.	2
521	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Like a Sam Shephard rural drama with the goofy idiosyncrasy of the Coen Brothers, Three Billboards gives a light to the unaccountable chaos of a tragedy, and the messiness of trying to make things right in the aftermath. The movie deals with redemption as much as forgiveness, and the dark sides of each, making the film less of a how-to, and more of a hypothetical example. Great cast, great character writing, great setting, great story.	2
522	Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie	I guess it's about time to apologize to my dad for dragging him to the cinema 14 years ago.	1
523	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Michael Bay, why can't you just die? 	1
524	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1	It's like a 2 hour long trailer for part 2. Is it a bad movie ? No, but lacks any action.	0
525	Gravity	I don't think anyone will be winning Oscars for acting or screenplay, but the setting and visual feel of this movie can stand above pretty much everything. This movie really gives you the sense of being basically left in space. Almost every second of this film is amazing. And nothing is more terrifying then seeing something getting destroyed and not hearing anything.	2
526	Battle Royale	The main flaw in this movie, I think, is the way we watch the movie from an outsider's perspective. It would have been so much more powerful if we had been watching more often from the perspective of the two main characters. We *see* too much of the killing. I never really felt scared and it was never really that exciting. It all went too mechanically, too casually... I expected more from this movie.	2
527	127 Hours	You can always count on Boyle to fuck up a potentially good film. He took a pretty good real life survival tale and trashed it with all his fakery. Boyle uses every MTV-device he knows to cram it up with false gimmicky excitement injections, obviously afraid of boring his audience. Ironically, that is exactly what happens: the original story drowned by a coke-driven camera (best exampled by... the drowning scene). So what we have is a story of being trapped trapped in an MTV music video.	0
528	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood	VERY disappointing. By far tarantino's worst. No captivating Tarantino dialouge; terrible pacing dragging then running, about a dozen different editing styles thrown in make simple scenes jarring and confusing, wasted cast, ZERO impact (the only reason the end is satisfying is because of the deviation from the real Tate murders, not from anything built up in the movie), three separate character arcs and none are compelling. Where did the Kurt Douglas narration come from? A boring flop	0
529	Moon	Impressive. Well acted and an excellent set. The plot isn't anything particularly brilliant, but it creates exactly the right mood. Spacey is great. More Alien than 2001 in terms of tone.	2
530	The Shape of Water	Finally, a movie for people like me. People who fuck fish.	1
531	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	This was good. Oh man, that felt good to write. But really, this was a good movie. I didn't expect it to be good. After all, nothing Star Wars related has been good for the past 30 years. But this... this was good. It wasn't great. It was a bit safe, played a whole bunch on nostalgia, and generally did what it needed to do without pissing too many people off. But it also felt new enough to be exciting and interesting. Yeah, this was good. You did good, team. Now don't fuck up the sequels.	2
532	Prometheus	I was baffled with this movie. It managed to astound me as an amazing sci-fi epic but also managed to crush my expectations in one fell swoop as it ended. The whole thing seemed so lazy in its attempt to pose big questions and then Scott shoehorned in the creation of the Alien just at the end. It was ridiculously messy for a Ridley Scott film also; I am a sci-fi nerd at heart and the visuals blew me away but the film itself was a rather big let-down. I'll stick to Blade Runner and Alien. 	0
533	Kick-Ass	Unlikeable characters. Immoral/unethical relationships that I might be able to overlook except that it's so egregious. Suggests realism and then throws it out the window. Creates a counter-argument for everything it purports itself to be. Is it some analysis of heroism like Watchmen, a semi-serious hero movie like Spiderman, or a flippant action movie like Wanted/Crank (2)? I don't think even Mark Millar knows.	0
534	Paranormal Activity	Low budget horror lives and dies with the atmosphere it creates.  Unfortunately, this film has very little to offer in the way of suspense. Flat, telegraphed scares, poor acting, and an abysmal studio-imposed ending remove all dread, leaving only eye-rolling boredom. 	0
535	Avengers: Endgame	An outstanding, emotional, satisfying end to a deep and complex film series, Endgame delivers a fitting tribute to 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe	2
536	The Piano Teacher	Yeeesh. What makes this film a masterpiece is the strange yet classic romantic build-up throughout most of the running time. Yeah, what she wants is fucked up, but you start to cheer for her to get it. And of course, when she does finally get her wish, it's pure Haneke. He used the same device in Funny Games, except without directly stating it to the viewer; we want this moment as much as she does, and when it happens it's horrible and we feel dirty for wanting it to happen.	1
537	2001: A Space Odyssey	There are many levels of understanding one can go through trying to decipher the visual clues of this masterpiece; it's the most complex, innovative and intelligent film I've seen.  The book helps your understanding, but Kubrick visually expands on several concepts that Clarke didn't touch on.  There are still many things in the film I don't understand, but that simply makes every re-watch all the more exciting.	2
538	Straw Dogs	A misogynistic adult version of Home Alone.	1
539	Madagascar	"Recipe for a Dreamworks movie: 
1. Take CGI of various talking animals
2. Throw in a bunch of celebrities
3. Mix in some bad pop culture references
4. And be sure to say it's from the makers of Shrek

Vooila!"	2
540	Forrest Gump	The message of this film seems to be that even an unwitting retard can excel in all areas of life as long as he does it in a wholesome American fashion and steers clear of those woman-beating liberal bastards in the counterculture.	0
541	The Passion of the Christ	Shows the brutality of Jesus' death, and that's something a lot of Christians don't really realize or think about when they think of the cross. His death isn't as important as his resurrection, and this movie only slightly hints at that at the end. Oops- spoiler.	0
542	Avengers: Age of Ultron	True to its nature as a sequel, AoU does what the first Avengers did, but faster, stronger, harder and definitely louder. I am, however, unable to come up with a single thing that it actually does better. An enjoyable enough ride, but the ending made it feel like it only served to bring together the team for the next Avengers movie.	0
543	War for the Planet of the Apes	Overrated. Great effects, but underwhelming as entertainment 	1
544	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Nowhere near as bad as the critics are making it out to be.  The expectations and standards that are being set for this movie are so unreasonably high that it had no chance of pleasing the professional haters. The mood was great, the sound was great, all the actors did a fine job. I was dreading Jesse Eisenberg as Lex after the trailers, but he did a surprisingly good job.  The movie was rushed and at 2:30 hours, it needed to be even longer, because the story could've been told better.	0
545	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	I'd really wanted to watch this in the cinema, but after hearing about the spoiler I knew I wouldn't be able to go since it'd crush my mom. Finally got around to watching it in October, 2017, and yeah, she was crushed. But she loved the rest of it, and we had fun. Probably the best retread of a movie I've seen (Evil Dead 2 was a bigger jump in quality, but Force Awakens is actually good), and the entire concept of Anakin is applied a bazillion times better in Kylo Ren. Likable MCs, too. Great.	2
546	The Big Lebowski	Three words: The dude abides. If you don't know what that means, then you really should try out this film.	0
547	The Babadook	The best of the Home Alone sequels by quite a bit.	2
548	Pan's Labyrinth	One of the very best films of the decade. A terrifyingly beautiful saga that masterfully blends the fantasy world of this girl's mind with the harsh reality of the Spanish Civil War. This film is a triumph of imagination.	2
549	Lucy	Coming from someone who would probably watch Scarlett Johansson do her taxes for an hour and a half, this is a painful film. Don't turn your brain off. Take it out, put it in a box, and set it in another room before starting this movie. 	0
550	12 Angry Men	Is this movie the perfect cross-section of America?  I mean each juror represents a type in American culture: the arrogant tough guy, trivial loser, wise but put-down older man, cold and calculating professional, charming salesman, self-loathing immigrant, the mocked immigrant, and -- maybe -- the humble critical mind.  Yes, the mind that does not say Yes or No with utter conviction behind it, but simply I don't know.  That's the mind America needs and is sorely lacking.  Remarkable film.	0
551	Armageddon	Nuclear devices have to be detonated manually. Oil miners make awesome astronauts. There's no physics or gravity in space. Girls hug their fiances (who they thought were dead) like their weird old uncle Travis. And asteroids get to break all the rules. I'm giving it 1 point because it won't let me give it zero. Update: I can now give it zero. This is the best moment of my life.	0
552	God's Not Dead	A frontrunner for the worst movie I've ever seen. Disgustingly manipulative and one sided, and littered with laughable performances, dialogue and directing, it often verges on hilarity but is otherwise devoid of any redeeming features. I was going to make some snide comment comparing this to intelligent filmmakers who tackle religion but that would be giving this too much credit. Fucking awful.	0
553	The Passion of the Christ	Eh.. the book was better	0
554	Beowulf	Imagine Lemmy from motorhead riding a dinosaur, surrounded by naked women, singing 'Ace of spades', chopping of heads with his axe which is also a bass guitar, and his sideburns on fire. This is what Beowulf is like.	2
555	It Follows	I was really impressed with the cinematography in this one (and want to see what this director can do with a bigger budget). Excellent camera work and manipulation of the frame and background vs. foreground. There was a creepiness to many of the forms the It took that felt fresh and original. Great atmosphere overall. This one will be discussed for some time.	2
556	Avengers: Endgame	Endgame is more of a homage to couple of Marvel movies and its characters than a movie on its own. It takes a risky road, leaves many unanswered questions (or u can say plot holes) Some of the characters and the choices in the movie disappointed me a little bit. However, the tone of nostalgia, extended unrushed narrative,(i love longer movies) emotional level and a few unexpected turning points in the story carry the movie to a certain level. Overall Endgame is a successful farewell to the saga.	2
557	District 9	'District 9' is brainier, but not grandiose (and that's a good thing), than your average alien movie. Seeing 'District 9', you get the feeling that this is something which is actually plausible - IF there were aliens, and IF they were to be stranded here in large numbers, this is more or less what will happen. This must also be the first humans vs. aliens movie, where I actually ended up rooting for the aliens.	0
558	Fifty Shades of Grey	Christian Grey put his thumb in my mouth. And then the other one. And then two more. Wider, he said as he put in one more. I bet you've never had this many thumbs in your mouth. I hadn't.	0
559	The Dark Knight Rises	I don't know if I was downright dissapointed. I just felt it was one big mess. But exciting none the less. So many storylines that were never explained. And many scenes I had a hard time watching (Alfreds goodbye for one). Zimmers music is what at least glues the movie somewhat together in a coherent atmosphere. But I couldn't help thinking all the time What the hell? - everytime someone did something with no apparent reason...	0
560	The Dark Knight Rises	I don't know if I was downright dissapointed. I just felt it was one big mess. But exciting none the less. So many storylines that were never explained. And many scenes I had a hard time watching (Alfreds goodbye for one). Zimmers music is what at least glues the movie somewhat together in a coherent atmosphere. But I couldn't help thinking all the time What the hell? - everytime someone did something with no apparent reason...	0
561	The Incredibles	Love it -- a great, funny story, wonderful voice work (particularly by Holly Hunter), and extremely well-choreographed action scenes, and realistic family emotions all make for a totally successful animated movie.	2
562	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles	best randomly generated title in history 	2
563	Phenomena	Jennifer Connelly, mutant children, insect swarms of Biblical proportions, Iron Maiden and Motorhead on the soundtrack, chimps with knives... this movie has it all!	1
564	Compliance	Compliance examines, among other things, how misplaced faith in authority can lead to abuse on a systemic scale. It's a deeply moral movie about the failure of morality, as grueling to watch as it is necessary. 	0
565	A Separation	Incredibly well-written and well shot, this dialogue-heavy drama felt as tense as a Hitchcock thriller. The characters are so well-rounded and complex, that you really go back and forth on who you're rooting for! The second I left the theatre, I knew it was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. A perfect ending to a near-perfect film.	1
566	Gerry	Dude, where's my Tarr?	1
567	This Is the End	Well... I guess that's cinema now.	1
568	Arrival	Frankly, What I expect from sci-fi is not great scientific analysis. In fact, everythin does not need to be scientificly true. It has very complex story with very good editing and great leading role by Amy Adams. That's enough for my sci-fi expectactions. Maybe it could have been better with less politic arguments and more family relations but anyway this movie is one of the best of this year's Oscar period.	2
569	The Village	People think that Shyamalan is a horror director, and are disappointed when they go to his movies and fail to be scared.  He is not, and really never has been, a horror director.  He directs dramas and uses mystery and fear to tell his stories.  That said, The Village was an excellent example of a great Shyamalan movie with a very textured atmosphere.	2
570	T2 Trainspotting	Pretty disappointing sequel. Unlike the original movie, which had themes touching upon friendship, trust, loyalty, and at the very least had a clearly defined character arc, this one had none of that. It had nothing new to say, the story was all over the place and didn't know which direction it wanted to take, and the dark comedy is all but absent here. It's still a decent watch, but can't hold a candle to the first movie.	0
571	Sorry to Bother You	@saladinahmed  Jul 20  So I finally saw SORRY TO BOTHER YOU and wow. It's like if IDIOCRACY had smarter politics and went on a date with GET OUT where they smoked a blunt and watched John Carpenter movie on VHS.  Just excellent.  Huge thumbs up, @BootsRiley.	2
572	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	Probably the most purely entertaining film I've ever seen. Leone is a master of tension and suspense, and makes brilliant use of landscape throughout the picture.	2
573	Silver Linings Playbook	Obnoxious, one-dimensional characters. Predictable, boring plot. iPods.	0
574	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	best gay vampire movie ever	1
575	Citizen Kane	I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.	1
576	Mulholland Drive	Notorious for its ambiguity, yet distinguished for its perspicuity, Mulholland Drive gives the viewer an overt, yet magnificent picture of the duality of a Hollywood-hopeful actress.  Vicious and sinister, while poignant and uncensored; beautiful, yet ominous -- there really isn't enough that can be said about this movie.  Each viewer will make his or her own interpretation, perhaps receiving an entirely different meaning altogether; and that's really the splendor of this movie.  Stunning.	2
577	The Squid and the Whale	A magnificent film which reveals the difficulties of being any age and a part of a family. It also helps to explain the effects that selfish and selfless behaviors have on others. The inferred meanings behind the actions of the characters speak far louder than their attempts to explain them.  	2
578	Eraserhead	Do you ever lay in bed at night, not being able to sleep, panicking about your life and the direction it is heading, feeling like there's a tightening rope around your chest, and it all just makes you want to scream? That is Eraserhead.	0
579	Fanny and Alexander	Absolutely perfect film, that breathes with profound life and humanity! Themes of life, death and everything in between and of course Bergman's wonderful sense of full, human characters. I felt like I was living, laughing and struggling with the Ekdahl family. I was a bit sad when it was over actually. Very powerful film, maybe my favourite ever.	2
580	A Few Good Men	A Few Good Scenes	2
581	Freddy Got Fingered	An amazing and hilarious piece of dada film making. Satirises  the movie industry, and its tendency to give large sums of money to  idiots. Watch a Uwe Boll film, and then see if you get the joke.	2
582	The Breakfast Club	I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff The jock see's the weird kid with make up on and then its love!!! Just able to connect so much with these people,  and then they all leave the nerd to write their papers ~ feel good classic	2
583	The Little Mermaid	An incredibly likable film. Very nice animation and characters, as well as some of the best songs Disney has ever brought. Disney might've faded from the minds of many people for many years. But then, The Little Mermaid came along. They were back.	2
584	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Don't believe the hype, don't believe the raving fanboys and  by no means believe the blatantly lying, Disney-bought critics. This is a storyless and soulless, stinking POS. Quoting youtuber Senju: it feels like a slighly surreal and very expensive fan film. It also feels like a sligthly too long (2hrs worth) movie trailer made by hipsters who think that having the old, genuine special effects is more important than having a story. 3/10. 1 for the genre, 1 for Harrison Ford and 1 for Chewie.	0
585	Groundhog Day	Among the most thought provoking movies ever made.  He changes because the day won't. Do I stay the same even though I get a new day every day?	2
586	Taffin	Well maybe you shouldn't be living here!	1
587	The Exterminating Angel	A strange piece of psychological survival-horror that turns the world upside-down as society's safest people are thrown into a hopeless ordeal. I love it for its simplicity-it's horror where the only monster is the madness and paranoia of the victims. The mystery is just that- a mystery that serves to fuel the human drama and social commentary. It needs no solution.	0
588	Twin Peaks	Daniel Kahneman says in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow that when you decide how much you liked (or disliked) an experience, you base it on how you felt at the peak, and how you felt at the end. That means that when evaluating Twin Peaks, I must be thinking mostly of the backwards talking dream from Episode 2 (peak brilliance/weirdness) and the haunting refrain of How's Annie? from the finale, which I guess explains why the score is so high.	2
589	Warm Bodies	Gently satirizes the Teen Paranormal Romance genre, not through mockery, but by displaying qualities that movies in that genre usually don't have: real emotion and characters you might care about. Asks questions most zombie movies don't bother to. It's a slight movie, thinly plotted and overdependent on musical cues, but it has heart. Possible cult classic potential down the road.	2
590	Gremlins 2: The New Batch	Insanely funny and kind of subversive; Joe Dante basically deconstructs the franchise that made his career.	2
591	V for Vendetta	Nothing is perfect, but this one comes stunningly near. I've seen V over forty times now, and I still discover new details every time. Weaving is nothing short of awesome, giving a masked man so many emotions. The monologues are amazing, some images are incredibly powerful.  And then there are a few scenes which are bound to give you goosebumps over and over again. Dominoes, anyone? 	2
592	Eighth Grade	Definitely brings the cringe. I liked the nod to perceived generational differences. The whole time I was hoping nothing bad would happen to her as a twist.	2
593	Halloween: Resurrection	After H20 ended things rather nicely, they had to get greedy and throw another log on the fire. And by log, I do mean shit.	1
594	The Hunchback of Notre Dame	A highly underrated Disney classic, with one of the most majestic scores ever.	2
595	Once Upon a Time in Anatolia	So real.. so natural.. I could just be there in the back seat of the car, or the guy in the next table in village chiefs house, or a patient in the hospital, I could be overhearing those conversations in real life. It could only be as natural as this. Great visuals, great acting, an effortless self flowing script, two and a half hours of character discovery, a unique movie experience.	2
596	Pacific Rim	One of the betet action films I've seen in recent years. For the first time, the power of today's CGI for such films is utilised properly (although it's really the animation more than anything that does this). Del Toro has finally proven himself capable of a blockbuster; there's nothing 'me too' about this film. The cast is masterfully chosen and all do a good job, and the idea for the world of pacific rim alone feels like more effort than the whole 3 films worth of the transformers franchise.	0
597	Pan's Labyrinth	Can be the best foreign film of last decade. Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful film of the fantasies and horrors a young girl lived 	2
598	Mad Max: Fury Road	"It's a feat for a movie series to enter its opulence phase and still retain the sensibilities that made it culturally resonate back in its early days. Fury Road shows what blockbusters can be, enormous, decadent spectacles but still capable of infusing its characters with emotional depth by adhering to a simple concept inherent to good cinema, show not tell.
From the incessant pace of the chases to the lull before the storm, Miller shows, and teaches, just how humanistic a simple story can be."	2
599	The Magnificent Seven	While this remake is largely a brainless exercise, it's still undeniably fun.	2
600	Vicky Cristina Barcelona	'Everything is uncertain when we talk about falling in love or being in love... the intensity is the only thing that counts... you can't just guess how much a feeling lasts...?!'  It's difficult to  imagine that a movie like that would came out of Woddy Allen's mind... I mean, not in that explicit way... but it works, and very well...     	1
601	Lost Highway	I was manipulated by a master of manipulation	1
602	Interstellar	If I was 15 years old and this was my 2001, I would be completely blown away. But I'm not, and it's not. The comparison to Kubrick is unfair, but understood: a multidimensional adventure, with honest humanity the whole way through. Nolan also successfully blends indie-film intimacy and blockbuster thematics. This is a massive movie with incredible creative intentions; my appreciation for the attempt overshadows the flaws. An immense watch, especially in 70mm IMAX.	2
603	Crank: High Voltage	I'd like to think of this as a pure expression of id, but I'm not sure I've got the faith in Neveldine/Taylor to make that statement.  Certainly it's the work of savants, and wildly entertaining for its excesses at times, but on the whole it's a more confused version of the first (vastly superior) film.  The punchlines are hit so much they're coming out in China, but the actual kinetics and memorable pieces of the first are lacking here. The Patton score is totally apt, as are the diversions.	0
604	Under the Shadow	Goes to show how a piece of fabric in the hands of competent filmmaker can be scarier than all the Hollywood millions tossed at CGI. It's what you don't see that makes up nightmares.	1
605	Pan's Labyrinth	The film is well done, the characters are realistic and show emotion. Visually stunning. Go see it.	2
606	Forrest Gump	One of the most insanely overloved movies ever made.  What are people seeing in this treacly, over-long, cloying, saccharine epic?  Is it the celebration of the dullard that makes America love this?  As time goes by, even the celebrated technical tricks fail to impress.  I don't get it.	2
607	Birdman	Technically marvelous and well acted, it's certainly an artful movie and I'm sure there's a lot of people who will love it, I'm just not one of them.  The script/dialog was kind of hit-or-miss for me, it kept bouncing back and forth between legitimately great and totally overblown.  I absolutely hated the incessant and pretentious free-form-jazz drumming. Top it off with an ambiguous ending which is sheer laziness as far as I'm concerned.  Am I laying it on too thick? Yes you are, Birdman.	0
608	Moulin Rouge!	One of a kind. Reinventing the musical, Luhrman did one very touching love story in a way most wouldn't dare to. Bautiful film.	2
609	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies	When thinking about it, this movie actually hasn't much going for it (e.g. the attempted love story is the most epic fail of all). Yet, seeing these fantasy creatures running around hitting each other in the head is entertaining. I honestly don't know why.	2
610	E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial	Few movies have aged as well as this good-alien fable.  It's a genuinely moving tale for the kid in all of us.  With Drew Barrymore in probably the cutest performance by a child actress ever.	2
611	The Predator	Uh so this is actually pretty great and I enjoyed it way more than I expected. Through and through a Shane Black movie despite some talk of reshoots. My personal enjoyment of this with a muted critical reaction reminds me of Chappie, another weird, dark, violent film with an off kilter sense of humour that wasn't appreciated.  It's weird because indie audiences can deal with wild shifts in tone in like, Korean movies, but can't stand it in domestic flicks. 	2
612	Godzilla vs. Hedorah	A Bond-esque opening for a movie about a pollution monster that shoots eye-beams, slow-motion fight scenes, people vanishing, this just screams hilarity.  The short animation scenes are a nice detail and have a very unique art style to it.  The scenes depicting the father speaking on the subject of where Hedora came from or what an atom bomb is felt as if I was watching a scene from an educational video.  The visuals are different from other Gojira movies, but that doesn't make it a bad thing.	2
613	Interstellar	if you really loved this movie, then we have a problem with you.. every nolan film gets worse than the former one and here is where we stand now. ordinary, cliche, nothing special.. excessive, always wannabe epic music usage (also sounds like ripped off from early philip glass), failure on character development etc. hard to find something to like in this flick. total let down.. unfortunately nolan keeps on getting more mediocre in every movie. what a disappointment.. (despite IMAX!)	0
614	Fight Club	A decent movie, but insanely overrated by people who missed the point entirely.	0
615	The Night of the Hunter	This movie is referred to as a classic, and as one of the best horror flicks of all time???  The acting is bad on all accounts, as well as the direction.  The screenplay is weak.  All of these I attribute to how much more sophisticated Hollywood is today compared to 50 years ago.  Nonetheless, this supposed classic fails to thrill and is not recommended (even for free--waste of time).	0
616	The Night of the Hunter	Robert Mitchum is fantastic, and Evelyn Varden is hilarious as Icey Spoon. Other than that, the acting is silly and the plot unfocused, with an especially weak ending.	2
617	Jurassic World	They can custom engineer their own dinosaurs but they can't afford working phones? Seriously, every time they tried to communicate with someone, it was static. This one adds an aquatic dinosaur, so if you thought any of the previous Jurassic Parks needed that then you'll like this one	0
618	The Avengers	Is this what cinema has come to? No suspense, no story, just big cgi explosions and cool and advanced high tech technology? Really not my cup of tea.	1
619	Cat People	Clearly this was Paul Schrader's elaborate scheme to shoot some scenes of Nastassja Kinski walking around naked (of which there should have been many more). 	0
620	A Star Is Born	The utmost respect for Cooper as an actor and director.  Two mediums combined are something that I find extremely powerful in story telling, and this one is heart-rending.  As recognizable as this path may be, it's without a doubt an emotional journey.	2
621	Shaun of the Dead	An odd, offbeat, absurd mix of comedy, parody, genuine horror, and tear-jerkers with surprising moments of character and style throughout. Somehow this works profoundly well, creating a movie that goes beyond a simple parody.	2
622	2012	I turned it off somewhere around Hawaii so I can only assume that everyone winds up dead	1
623	Whiplash	The writing is that of a conventional modern thriller with a plot that's spread thin and heavily exaggerated at points, breaks primarily serving to whet the appetite for the next confrontation between Neiman and Fletcher and not much else, but Whiplash's spin on this is a spellbinding master-student relationship that's more like a war between two aspects of the same consciousness. A breakneck pace that lives up to its title, and the only thing the ending promises is the same never-ending spiral.	2
624	The Act of Killing	I've never seen a documentary that could portrait such a balance between totally absurd humor and pure horror.	0
625	Skyfall	W...T...F? how come i keep reading best bond yet?In the top 250 at IMDB?Did i miss something here?Tho the movie was well made, well acted and well directed it had so many flaws.Pacing was off,the best actor(who also gave the best performance)was on screen for like 15 minutes and 4 scenes.The ending was SUCH an anti climax it was ridiculous. And the script/story were so simple..it started off so good but all went downhill from there.. so many things just left unexplained... i felt a bit robbed 	0
626	Free Fire	Before this movie, I didn't think you could stretch a shootout to feature length while still keeping it entertaining. I was right.	2
627	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Michael Bay is now in my book on par with Roland Emmerich and Uwe Boll.  RoTF is a mess. It has all the trademarks of a  Bay movie minus the charms that made those movies enjoyable. Acting is bad, action is unclear and i found myself often wondering what was going on. The script, well what can i say? The whole thing feels like random action sequences thrown together. It's the first movie in which i felt guilty paying for it and thus supporting the possible sequels. 	0
628	Donnie Darko	I've heard  many people (mostly teenaged girls) claim that this movie changed their life.  I think I know what they're talking about: I went from someone who hadn't seen a film with Smurf-related dialogue to someone who had in under two hours.	0
629	Juno	I liked it, wasn't expected. Juno is some kind of annoying character but the end was cool. Feel good movie. Ellen Page's acting and soundtrack are great.	2
630	Pacific Rim	Almost any director would screw something as loud and, I guess simple, as this - but del Toro handles the project with a passion that shows through every reel.  His most impressive feat is having fight scenes that are easy to follow - something much more difficult than it sounds when the technology and language are completely made up.  The movie takes itself too seriously, but somehow that's okay too in this case. 	2
631	Skyfall	Dark Spy Rises. House of M. A Storm is Coming. Apocalypse Now. Die, Die My Darling. James Bond and the Chamber of Secrets. Why So Serious? 	2
632	Eyes Wide Shut	I LOVE THIS FILM FROM MY CHILDHOOD BECAUSE OF SEXUAL PLEASURE ACTIVITY.	2
633	The Fountainhead	So bad it's good, so strangely fascinating, Ayn Rand was obviously insane	2
634	Arrival	The movie straight up pulls a bait-and-switch on its audience, and that's a fatal flaw that can't be forgiven. The entire premise of the movie is pretty much thrown away in the ending just to propose some philosphy from left field, and it feels like a complete cheat.  Most of the middle of the movie is also ho-hum. It's not terrible, but lacks the careful lore and world-building of similar movies. Lots of jargon and psuedoscience thrown around, all of which matters not in the end.	0
635	The Wizard of Oz	Probably the most enduring film in American history.  Therefore, as someone who doesn't care to understand the technical subtleties that make Citizen Kane the generally accepted best film ever, I nominate this as the greatest movie of all time.  3 generations from now CK will still be a film class staple while The Wizard of Oz will still be a living room staple.	0
636	The Lego Movie	This movie is an exciting and fun joyride through my childhood memories in all kinds of colours and shapes there are in the Lego universe and puns I wouldn't have expected there. I enjoyed this immensely - in a cinema full of adults who I'm sure scurried home to play with some Lego right afterwards! Also: Everything is awesooooome....!	2
637	A Quiet Place	Have you ever wished that Signs had been the most tense, edge-of-your-seat apocalyptic horror movie you had ever seen? A Quiet Place is that movie, a version of monsters on earth that is the best horror/thriller I have ever seen. An amazing experience.	2
638	Fences	Too close to the theatrical script for a film. Great performances, bad cinema. Would have been better if they had just filmed a stage showing, or literally re-written the whole thing transforming words into images.	0
639	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Icing on the cake.  Finally, one sequel to rule them all.	1
640	Catwoman	I had a lot of time to kill and nothing to do, so I decided to watch this instead of staring at the wall. A bad choice.	0
641	Eighth Grade	Because most of us were eighth-graders millions of years ago, we’re like Kayla’s dad. We see what a bright, interesting, resilient young woman Kayla is. Unlike Kayla, we also see that the young people around her, the popular kids throwing pool parties at their huge homes and the nerdy cousins and the handsome (barely pubescent) jocks all have their own growing pains.  Which makes Eighth Grade one of the realest looking movies about pre-high-school I’ve ever seen.  	0
642	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	One of the most original, moving, humane, and comic films I've seen.  It encaptures so much truth about memories, human emotion, and the romantic nature of love.  I can not find words to express how much this movie means to me, nor can I pick out how or why the film works the way it does.  This is one of those that in the long run I believe will be considered one of the undying classics in film history.	2
643	Guardians of the Galaxy	A living, breathing comic book and the perfect embodiment of its absurd source material. Star-Lord's false bravado expertly disguises his heart of gold. Rocket is a furious ferret with a Napoleon complex.  Groot grounds him like the tree that he is and steals every scene. Gamora and Drax are muscle with funny bones. Comedy, drama, romance, action...there's something for everybody and anybody. The galaxy depicted is diverse like that. Why should its guardians be any different?	2
644	The Ballad of Buster Scruggs	 the first part is by far the best, combining Coens death pan and dark humor in which they play perfectly with the contrast between a 1950s flamboyant type cowboy and the more grittier Westerns of later decades . I was laughing my ass off. Unfortunately none of the segments after that could deliver on the promise set by that. Some of the segments still were also very good (part 2, 4), some good (5 and 6) and one (part 3) just plain boring.	0
645	A Bittersweet Life	Slick, stylish and tons of extreme tension.	2
646	The Lion King	I've spent hours trying to convince people that Mufasa is the real villain of The Lion King. Mufasa's policy of expelling the hyenas to barren lands and arguing that the separation follows nature's order is an allegory of apartheid, complete with Bantustans (the wastelands). Mufasa's power basis is that of a Czar: Welfare for the ruling class (lions) at the expense of the underclass (hyenas), combined with religious mysticism (the monkey). Scar is no hero, but the hyena revolt is justified.	0
647	The Wizard of Oz	Sacrilege, I know, but this movie is overly simplistic and heavy-handed. A good film to use as an introduction to good films when you're trying to educate your nephew. Otherwise, it's a purely nostalgic exercise. 	1
648	Justice League	The movie introduces three new characters: Cyborg is a living plot device, Flash is sometimes funny, often terribly unfunny and Aquaman, while being the most interesting out of all three, does nothing except say YEAHYUH at one point. The villain is the worst villain of every movie ever and so ridiculously overpowered that every fight scene is boring by default. Batfleck obviously wants to leave the franchise as soon as possible. At least Gal is here to carry yet another DC movie by herself.	0
649	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Exciting and sentimental, The Force Awakens adds some new flare to the Star Wars Saga, though where it falters is that it goes by too fast without being able to really relate to these new characters. Much of it feels like exposition and a set up for a trilogy, and it doesn't always feel like classic Star Wars because of its fast paced nature, but its glorious moments and thrilling galactic visuals mostly make up for these faults. It leaves you wanting to see so much more.	2
650	War of the Worlds		1
651	Band of Brothers	This is the most epic, visually stunning, all encompassing war film of all time. Of course strictly speaking it is a mini-series which helps in forming a bond with the characters who are based on actual soldiers many of whom were alive during the filming and create an incredible sense of reality with a foreword for each episode.  It is engaging from start to finish, despite what you know about WWII you will be in awe at what the soldiers faced together and it is sure to tap into your emotions!	2
652	Under the Skin	A film light on answers wrapped in strong visuals, would normally be an easy target for the form over content critique. Glazer however gets the balance right, and guides the audience with a bleak tone and utterly thrilling and captivating sequences. The random beach encounter scene especially will hold you from blinking, start to finish. 	2
653	The Room	Thank you, honey, this is a beautiful party! You invited all my friends. Good thinking!	2
654	2001: A Space Odyssey	Masterpiece... Represent the art in the movie culture...When you see this movie you can not believe that has made in 1968.	2
655	Oblivion	Oblivion is a visually stunning sci-fi achievement. It has some set backs, but they are easily missed thanks to the wonderful sci-fi scenery. The technology is awesome, the story is classic sci-fi, and it is all delivered on some of the best budgeting hollywood can offer. Tom Cruise, I am glad to say it, does a good job. If anything, see this movie for the art inside, if sci-fi is your thing. 	2
656	Irreversible	Holy... what a ride! During the rape scene I had decided to give this movie a 0 out of sheer protest, but then I changed my mind... Id need more space than this gives me to properly describe my emotions concerning this movie. Anyways: fantastic acting and I especially loved the scenes before (well after, in the movie) the rape. They would, however, not have had the same effect without the excessively long violent scenes. 	2
657	The Shining	Here's Johnny! ...What can I say about this film that hasn't been said? It's a legendary, cinematic masterpiece of a film. Most horror movies straddle a thin line between being overbearing and cheesy, and being spine-tingling and unnerving. I must say The Shining comes through each time as the latter, no matter how many times you watch it. A true classic, if you haven't seen it - you're missing out.	0
658	Cosmopolis	A film about capital, currency, ambition, and the complete emptiness of the pursuits of civilisation in the face of the unknowable.  An honest appraisal of the irrelevance of human civilisation when placed against the unstoppable entropy of the cosmos.  This is what happens when we reduce life down to systems, processes, actions, reactions, commodities, fractions, algorithms and data, while forgetting to recognise the beauty in variation, inconsistency, the unexplainable, and the undefinable.	1
659	Crash	WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE WHITE PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE MEXICAN PEOPLE ASIAN PEOPLE	1
660	Crash	Made me cry when I saw it, now I'm not really sure why. Kind of overwrought.	0
661	The Counselor	It's been a while since I had seen a movie that froze my blood.	1
662	Infernal Affairs	better than departed in the way that a NES is better than a N64	2
663	Prometheus	What? The guy with Alien and Blade Runner now makes THIS? I guess it's called PROmetheus, just because it's a PRO-creationist PROpaganda, that anyone with a background of 2-3 average sci-fi books will find unbearable to watch. The characters (straight-out from Lost, as one can expect given the screenwriter) are doing nothing but talk how important questions their mission will address. At the end of the day we get Daniken-like nonsense at its worse. Even the beauty can't save this horrific mess.	0
664	Amadeus	Classic. Everyone needs to watch this - it's one of the few films that succeeds on every level. Some of the opera sequences might be slow for those who don't appreciate them, however. 	2
665	Cyberbully	She couldn't get the cap off	1
666	Rampage	Of course it is CGI-heavy, but better than I expected. The Rock delivers in not only a powerhouse action role but as a compassionate animal-lover as well. 	2
667	Ex Machina	Mesmerizing movie from Garland that intrigues from the very first second with its lingering and obsessive pace. An intelligent script, full of philosophical subtext that all probably derived from the question; Can machine have consciousness? There's quality in every detail on this movie, from the production design to the score. But a lot rests on the shoulders of the actors who needs to hide what's going on while still managing to engage and seduce the audience, which Vikander does so perfectly.	2
668	Inglourious Basterds	The perfect feast for hardcore Tarantino fans. This was a long wait especially after him saying that this could be the masterpiece of the decade. Excellent script and screenplay, all the actors did justice to their roles. Loved the first chapter, which was the perfect beginning for a crude, dark and witty tale. Two thumbs-up for Tarantino!	2
669	The Curse of the Were-Rabbit	This is what movies for children should be.	1
670	Creed	A new film in the Rocky franchise that can actually go toe to toe with the first Rocky film! This film is amazing, Coogler is another director who shows that if you want to revive a franchise, have a fan of that franchise at the helm. Coogler is a fan and he shows it. Jordan and Stallone are amazing, especially Stallone who arguably turned in his best performance yet! It will be really exciting to see what Coogler, Jordan and Stallone do with the Creed sequel.	2
671	Robot and Frank	D: Oh god, you mean there's douchey hipsters in the future too??!?!	1
672	Irreversible	Pretty groundbreaking stuff. One of the most gruelling film experiences you'll ever endure but innovative and brilliantly made. Contains the most horrific and discomforting example of violence against women I've ever seen.	1
673	Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi	If you aint down with wickett, then go F yourself. 	1
674	World War Z	Good, but a bit rushed. I would of liked to have seen more of the devistation and effects caused by the mass hordes of zombies though. Didn't need to be 18/R rating, but would of been interesting to see what it may of added if it was.	0
675	Roman Holiday	Audrey Hepburn's crowning role! The perfect blend of comedy and drama without going over-the-top. Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert make the right moves in the backfield allowing Hepburn to light up the screen. I've heard people claim that Hepburn was a limited actress because of her one-dimensional acting ability...irrelevent; Audrey is Princess Anne! My personal favorite Audrey movie of them all!	2
676	Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie	this shit was like porn for me back in my childhood days. nowadays, its kinda like that self reflective moment right after the climax where you become self aware and just feel dirty	2
677	This Is the End	Like superhero movies, this type of comedy became extremely popular a few years back, but is finally wearing out its welcome.  In a way this is the quintessential Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow generation comedy: It's a relaxed style, off-the-cuff stoner comedy with gross-out bawdiness and the actors play themselves (this time literally).  The script is weak and completely without structure or message.  Lot's of talented, funny people keep it afloat, but it's time these comedies got less lazy. 	2
678	Hitch	In this sophisticated romantic comedy HAHAHHAHHAHA	2
679	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	Entirely devoid of soul. A filmmaker simply going through the motions.	0
680	Celda 211	The film is like a freakin' grinder. Swallows you from a side, chews you around with unmatched brutality, and tosses you out from the other side completely exhausted. Every shot boils with scathing intensity. Every scene questions your sanity. It is hard to sit through the movie without flinching and squirming, and remind you this is not a horror film. Cell 211 has two words written all over it. Cult. And Classic.	2
681	The Wolf of Wall Street	A comedy that almost fails at being a comedy. It took all my willpower to sit through the first hour, after which it did improve but the distaste left the rest hard to enjoy. I am usually all for longer movies but this film just plain and simple is FAR too long. Could EASILY be half the length and in my opinion would be a better movie. No issues with acting, but if you're gonna make a 3 hour comedy with unrelatable characters, you gotta make it a lot funnier than LEO DOES COKE, LOOK TITS HA. No.	0
682	The Birds	Interesting concept ruined by aggravating, dare I say unlikable, characters with simplistic dialogue. Hedren is just downright annoying. This is one of the few films where I've found myself wishing some of the characters would just shut up. The suspense is lost when Hitchcock keeps having to remind the viewer of events that happened just a few minutes ago. The final few scenes are particularly suspenseful because the characters are finally silent and it's only then that the horror becomes real.	0
683	Attack the Block	like Snakes on a plane it's dumb, mostly unfunny, but on the contrary of SOAP, it takes itself way too seriously. it's just really hard to understand what all this fuss about. year's biggest hype.	0
684	Executive Decision	This is a thriller every tough short guy should see. B.D. Wong (not quite five and a half feet tall, and of slight build) and John Lequisamo (a few inches taller) play tough-as nails Special Forces commandos who survive a complex, dramatic and violent rescue of an airliner that terrorists have hijacked. Macho man Steven Seagal is a full foot taller than Wong. He looks big, and *is* larger than life, but he is blown away (literally) before he even boards the plane. This is strangely satisfying. 	2
685	Manos: The Hands of Fate	The soundtrack is what really sells this movie. More horror movies should incorporate light jazz.	2
686	Shaun of the Dead	While being one of the funniest movies ever, it also manages to be one of the most realistic interpretations of a zombie outbreak. I'm genuinely convinced most people would react like Shaun if they were thrust into a zombie scenario.  	2
687	A Clockwork Orange	There was something wrong with my DVD and I spent about 45 minutes staring at an orange rectangle on a black screen while weird music played. After seeing other movies by Kubrick, I just didn't question it.	1
688	Avengers: Endgame	Perfect. Fucking. Movie.	2
689	Mission: Impossible - Fallout	The hype is very real. I'll get it out of the way at the beginning and say that Fallout isn't nearly as smartly written as say a Casino Royale or a Bourne Identity, so if you had consistent issues with the writing in previous series entries, you'll likely find Fallout entertaining but not amazing. That aside, it contains some of the best action setpieces in the last decade. Every single one is incredible and the whole movie is consistently beautiful.	2
690	Breeders	Utterly shit, but hilariously so. The climax, where the baddie explains the evil alien plot as his skin bubbles & splits in alien transformation, while our heroes just stare in seeming bored exasperation, & naked chicks with 80s hairdos writhe in a soft-core alien spooge orgy nearby, is fucking gold.	1
691	Super Size Me	The first time I saw this movie, I enjoyed it. Yes, eating nothing but fast food is obviously bad for you but I thought the concept was solid (I still do). Watching it a second time, you see how mean spirited and self righteous Spurlock can get. Instead of trying to dig deeper and get the whole story behind the problems with fast food (and why we as a culture are driven towards eating it), he spends that time blatantly making fun of overweight people. That's not a documentary, its just childish.	0
692	Se7en	One of my favorite suspense thrillers...	2
693	Sicario	"I hope you like feeling like you're in actual, physical danger for 2 hours.  I do.
"	1
694	Trainspotting	Imagine the lowest dirtiest humor; but make it British and actually funny.  That's this film, with a moral ending.	1
695	John Wick: Chapter 2	From Stahelski's direction to Keanu's acting and stuntwork, John Wick: Chapter 2 is everything the first one was and a little bit more. John Wick 2 sees the world open up more and I loved what that showed me. We saw more assassins, more John Wick foes, more grueling hand-to-hand combat, and more gun fu. I cannot wait to see what the third installment has in store.	1
696	Raising Arizona	Just a whole lot of fun, really. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter play the stereotypical redneck characters to the T and actually make character archetypes I normally hate completely likable. Of course John Goodman and William Forsythe are also great. The movie is ridiculously over the top in a good way and, well, so far the Coen bros. have impressed me.	0
697	Dogtooth	Neat idea but done in a truly awful way. Ultimate shock for the sake of shock alone.	1
698	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	"Snyder made a true fanboy fiction flick (I mean look at Wonderwoman). And Eisenberg grew so much as an actor that I'm feeling proud just by looking at him. 
Overall it's something what you would expect from films that have words like dawn or beginning in the title."	2
699	Grave of the Fireflies	This is an adult Japanese animated movie that explores how war effects the most vulnerable and innocent people in the most horrific ways.  This is one of the saddest and most haunting movies I have ever seen.It's unflinching deception of two young lives ravaged and then ultimately destroyed by war's brutality left me in tears and emotionally drained  This is a masterpiece in film making and one of the greatest movies I have seen.Two Thumbs Very Enthusiastically Up ! 	2
700	Crocodile Dundee II	Nah, needs garlic.	1
701	The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp	Some of the ugliest women I've seen in a movie.  Pretty well done, though.	2
702	A Nightmare on Elm Street	While this remake/ reboot does some things well its major flaw is its re-imagining of Freddy himself.  The original Freddy was so fascinating that the movie had a thousand sequels to show more of him, and this one is just boring.  just a burned dude with knife hands: none of the humor, wackiness, and gross appeal of the original.  Also every time this re-does a famous moment from the original they manage to make it look worse than it did over 20 years ago.   	1
703	Raging Bull	A heart wrenching and powerful story of an emotionally self-destructive man; Raging Bull takes you to somewhere that most films can't even dream of. Direction of Scorsese is perfect (his absolute best work) and when it combines with breathtaking cinematography, brilliant acting and screenplay the result is one of the greatest works of art. After multiple viewings you realize this may possibly be the greatest American movie ever made; even topping the likes of Citizen Kane, The Godfather etc.	2
704	The French Connection	Honestly didn't lead up to the hype. Whole lotta nothing going on throughout film, which I assumed was just building for climax of film that wasn't that great of a climax. What a letdown. I'd been wanting to see this for a long time after hearing how awesome it was. Not sure what everybody else watched, this certainly wasn't awesome.	2
705	Zeitgeist: The Movie	Whether or not you believe everything that is said, this is still a spine-tingling polemic. The imagery is powerful, and the the arguments are powerful. POWERFUL!!	2
706	Avengers: Endgame	Sorry, but what a bloated movie. overstocked with cheap heart-moments and small-universe syndrome. Also, these guys were built up for so many movies to be simply upstaged by a shoe-horned Captain Marvel (put her vs Thanos and Wakanda vs his army, call it good). Thor did nothing (though funny at first), after shining in Ragnarok. Hulk did even more nothing. There's not enough space to go into all the disappointment. And even if I wasn't invested in the characters it still wouldn't be a good film.	0
707	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	As engrossing as the original three. We get action and adventure and the characters have more than two dimensions.There's only one thing I want to know: how could anyone get seduced by the dark side of the force? I mean, what is so goddamn tempting about it??? Did they not learn from the empire's downfall?	2
708	Manhattan	I rewatched it last night after a long time, from the period where Woody Allen films were nothing more than something very pleasant for me, and was blown away. It's so windy and light that you immerse yourself completely in it, the compositions, the relationships you don't have. It's all fun and games. Somewhere, just before the ending, you realize you're on an emotional roller-coaster. And you don't believe it cause it's all so easy, but you leave happy, nauseous and shaking. Or is it just me?	0
709	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	This felt more like a high-budget fan film than a solid Star Wars movie. There are many very pretty scenes, but everything that's presented to us feels like it amounts to not much. We walked away feeling very underwhelmed and like we just watched a 150min commercial for the latest plush toys. All this may be a setup for the final film, but by itself it's very...meh. 	0
710	Her	"Her is Emotionally sophisticated and Visually absorbing. a strange wonderful tale between a man and computer that is genuinely heartfelt and passionately imaginative. Spike Jonze has achieve tremendously not only because of his artistic brilliance, but also his ability to envision the future of human relationship with technology as well as re-evaluate the fundamental aspect of human emotion.
it is such an impressive feat that it could already be counted as a modern classics in years to come."	2
711	Inglourious Basterds	Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction. Excellent story, great cast and characters, some fine pacing, and definitely in the Tarantino style.	2
712	The Pervert's Guide To Ideology	Has totally revived my appetite for films. Other than that, I love the bullshitfree approach, the pretentiouslessness that Zizek applies in his dynamic analysis and assertion. It's for dummies and super digestible, it truly is. Watch it! (especially if you don't go all crazy when a tiny spoiler comes alog - if you do, who cares, you should have seen all those films by now if you are so devoted to cinema).	0
713	Coco	I honestly believe this is the best film to come from Pixar since possibly Toy Story. It is full of love and humor and beauty. Please go see it and support films that celebrate other cultures! And bring some tissues with you.	2
714	Seven Samurai	Spectacular movie, especially since it was made in 1954.  The acting, the plot, the varied shots, the lack of goofs make this an essential meal in your movie diet.  	2
715	Passengers	Any music supervisor that still uses the Junkie XL Elvis Little less conversation song in movies in 2016 needs to take a serious, deep, long look in the mirror and ask themselves the question if music supervision is really the job that brings out their qualities.	2
716	Ghostbusters	Quite disappointing. The ghosts look great, but the script is weak and the characters are very underdeveloped. I love Kate McKinnon, but I can't for the life of me understand her or the director's or the writers' choices for her character especially. My 8yo niece wasn't that entertained either.	0
717	Tangled	I was worried that it might not meet my (really high) expectations, but it did. GORGEOUS animation, great music, beautiful story - this is proof that Disney doesn't need Pixar to make an amazing animated movie and, what's most important, can still produce a fairy-tale that feels both classic and fresh at the same time. Loved it!	2
718	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	The perfect collaboration of a great visionary mind in Gondry and a master storyteller in Charlie Kaufman. Reinvented the romantic comedy into a fantastic and heartfelt voyage into the mind and heart of the movie's main character. Stellar performances by the whole cast, Jim Carrey in particular (funny how comedians so often make great drama actors). A must see for anyone with a brain and a heart. 	2
719	The Big Lebowski	Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes click.	2
720	Trick 'r Treat	Pulp Fiction meets Halloween meets Creepshow and most every horror subgenre out there. Several interwoven stories set on Halloween that incorporate serial killers, vampires, zombies, and assorted other horror favorites. The visual style is amazing, and the movie captures the look of Halloween better than most any film since Carpenter's classic. I didn't think that it could live up to the hype- most horror movies don't- but Trick 'R Treat certainly earned all of the good will that it's gotten.	2
721	Pan's Labyrinth	I thought the movie was amazing when I saw it. The making of... turned it into the masterpiece in my eyes.	2
722	Slow West	A largely predictable and by-the-numbers western period drama is elevated by many great performances and some great cinematography.	2
723	The Village	M. Night get's so much crap but I absolutely love his storytelling, and the cinematography for this one is particularly eye catching.	2
724	Mad Max: Fury Road	Almost certainly the best action movie of the decade so far.  Creating narrative without exposition has never looked so easy, or so beautiful.	2
725	Bohemian Rhapsody	There is a lot of confusing chronological issues with songs. Who wants to live forever played when Freddie get ready for 1985 Live Aid but WWtLF is song from 1988. Under Pressure played when it wasnt even released yet !   Also there was some bad choice of cgı and make-ups that make the movie a bit worse.  Also there is some movie additions and exclutions on the real story of course. But most of 'em are understandable.  Strongest part of the movie is acting and the whole story behind live aid co	0
726	Romeo and Juliet	Who doesn't love the first time you ever saw breasts in a high school classroom movie?	0
727	The Hunchback of Notre Dame	One of Disney's darker films.  Certainly too much for me as a young child.  But a delight now, with incredible music.	2
728	United 93	There is no way a better movie could have been made about this subject. There are no Hollywood type heroes, there are no politics or patriotic bullshit, and there is no false dramatization (like Titanic or any other disaster movie). This is as close to Documentary as it gets, and while being almost a documentary, this is the most emotional rollercoaster you will see all year. From feeling hopelesness in the beginning to absolutely terrified in the end, this is one of the best movies I have e	0
729	Joe Dirt	Is this queer!?! This queer?!?!  Liked it, got a soft spot for David Spade's comedy. Plus, Joe Dirt is a side to Spade that I've never seen before. Not the snarky lovable a-hole he usually is, but a sweet down on his luck simpleton hillbilly.	2
730	Wonder Woman	It's a wonder I stayed awake through it.	2
731	The Fountain	A movie that is beautiful and artistic, but ultimately tries too hard with repetitive symbolism and metaphor. This might work in a film that has something more original to say, but ultimatly this falls short. 	2
732	Back to the Future	Very possibly the best movie ever made.  Almost certainly the movie I've seen the most.  It's a fucking master's class in economical storytelling, character development, and three-act plotting and it's all tied together by a story I found genuinely moving - the redemptive power of science!	2
733	44 Inch Chest	Ray Winstone is great as always, and the supporting cast is good as well.  But although there are a few great moments, overall the film is too uneven and pointless to really be engaging.	1
734	Avengers: Age of Ultron	Character development of Black Widow felt contrived, as did her romance with the Hulk. The female superheroes and other female characters all seem token in the Avengers series. It put me off that they had Black Widow saying she felt like a monster because she couldn't have children and idealized Hawkeye's secret barefoot in the kitchen wife.	0
735	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	An unfairly neglected throwback to the adventure movies of the thirties.  Don't be such a sourpuss; it's good fun.	2
736	Caligula	This is the kind of garbage that makes you feel as if the Apostles have crucified you to the floor and taken a major piss into your mouth through a funnel. I just love it when a director creates a 156-minutes worth graphic mishmash of violent gore, melodrama, incest, genital mutilation, rape, necrophilia, horse-fucking, mass orgies and hardcore pornography and calls it revolutionary cinema. I would tell this movie to go fuck itself but it most probably would.	0
737	Crash	Skillfully done with some nice moments but all in all a slightly disappointing treatment of the book.  More could be done visually and there's some ridiculously inappropriate music at times.  Stretches the boundaries of what Hollywood accepts but not nearly radical enough for the novel.  Ballard says cars, violence and politics are pornography and pornography is today's society. Cronenberg subverts this into a fetish shared by a small group of weirdos which is a wasted opportunity.	0
738	Deadpool 2	I mean...shit it was awesome. Deadpool 2 is really just the first one with a bigger budget, it’s even referenced a few times. The movie is fairly predicable, and it kind of does play on some jokes from the first one, but you’re gonna have fun. The writing still superb, even with a new team behind it, Dennison and Brolin playing their respective roles (kid and Cable) and despite being longer, the movie never slows down and quite frankly it’s hard to imagine this being better than it is.	2
739	Joy	Well, this movie is... underwhelming? Close to dissappointing? I dunno, I just expected so much more, and I got so little. Jennifer Lawrence is stellar, as always, and she carries this whole movie because other than her, there's not much to it, honestly (poor writing, weak plot). But sadly not even that could save it for me. 	0
740	Funny Games	Haha, those were some pretty funny games	2
741	Lost in Translation	Thoroughly unlikable people who don't know who they are or what they want and just wallow in their unsatisfactory lives.  Even if that is exactly what the filmmaker set out to create... I'm not the audience who finds that entertaining. 	0
742	Cold War	Not so much sweeping love story as portrayal of a dysfunctional, destructive relationship. The short running time left the main characters feeling somewhat enigmatic and hard to judge. To the film and actors' credit, they were still believable. Beautifully shot and involves a lot of musical moments which might have a more profound effect on others but only left me intrigued and not transported. Well made and interesting movie, that I think will be something special for those on its wavelength.	1
743	Hotel Chevalier	Four words: Natalie Portman's nekkid butt.	0
744	Arrival	Villeneuve is definitely the master of suspense. This is one of the most rational sci-fi I have ever seen, owes much to Contact.	2
745	Mad Max: Fury Road	radically different from about every other recent action film and therefore so much better.	0
746	Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol	While lacking Brad Bird's characteristic characterization, Ghost Protocol is an awe-inspiring throwback to old spy films. The film is carried by an excellent cast, incredible stunts, truly witty dialogue and Bird's kinetic direction.	2
747	Inception	Inception was mostly spectacle and overwroughtness for its own sake to be perceived as high art. The CGI was laughable in many places as were many of the actors. Sorry folks, DiCaprio just isn't a leading man. He just isn't.  Tom Hardy and Ellen Page were the best things about it. But again, not nearly enough character development. It was also quite predictable in places despite its blatant convolutedness.Great score and some good ideas tossed around but largely lackluster.  	0
748	Kung Pow: Enter the Fist	What a train-wreck disaster. This isn't a parody or spoof, it's a mockery. The bastardisation and butchering of great Shaw gems with this nonsense american crap...! There's nothing positive to say about it. 	0
749	The Nightmare Before Christmas	The stop-motion effects give this somewhat untraditional Christmas movie a eery overtone that fits the creepy Halloweentown perfectly. Catchy songs and great character designs also help.	2
750	Tropic Thunder	Go ahead, be offended. I don't mind. In fact, its all part of the joke -- a joke that works for about 90-minutes straight, making Tropic Thunder one of the funniest films of the year.	2
751	Crash	Deep down inside, the apparently nice guys are racists, and the apparent racists are really nice guys!  DO YOU SEE?  DO YOU SEE?	2
752	The Thing	Really well paced and very tense. Usually in older effects movies, I spend most of the time distracted by how fake it looks, but the special effects mostly hold up. In The Thing, I was thinking, That's FUCKED UP, which I imagine is exactly what John Carpenter was going for. Maybe the best horror movie I've ever seen.	2
753	Million Dollar Baby	A movie completely convinced of its own thoughtfulness, as evidenced by Freeman's annoying narration and generally overblown performances. This would just be annoying if it wasn't for the way the screenplay writes its characters in broad, easy-to-understand strokes. The worst is Swank's white trash family, so ridiculously overdone they absolutely kill the dramatic importance of any scene they're in. Worst of all, it's plain boring.	0
754	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	I can't summon the words to sufficiently describe the enjoyment I felt during this movie.	2
755	American Hustle	This film took modern A-listers and a needlessly obfuscated plot, and forced it into a wannabe 90s Scorsese mold.  Disappointing and unengaging in almost every aspect. I liked the soundtrack, but more often than not it took me out of the film.  Passed the time but would not watch again and cannot recommend.	0
756	The Matrix	One of the more thought-provoking sci-fi titles, Matrix does it in superb style with intense action, generaly good (although sometimes a bit cliche) philosophy and a very fitting soundtrack. The acting is indeed bad on some occasions, especially from Keanu Reeves, but doesn't really harm the movie. I also missed some depper relationship and philosophical progression (although the movie definately makes you think), and it's really sad that next 2 movies just fell in quality for me.	0
757	Guardians of the Galaxy	Supremely well directed and tightly paced comic book action movie with spectacular visuals. Perhaps a little light on dramatic content, and certainly lacking in character backstory - but at the same time, it's nice to see a film with strong, positive themes which are tied into the narrative and embodied in the actions of the characters, rather than verbalising them every five minutes. A worthy successor to Star Wars for this generation of kids. Oh - and Dave Bautista was fantastic. Who knew!	2
758	While You Were Sleeping	Very cute and very funny. Pullman and Bullock are great together. 	2
759	Fiddler on the Roof	First of all, the soundtrack is awesome in a way that perfectly fits the tragic and often melancholy tone of the film.  Secondly, though it is a musical, this is also an important historical drama that takes on the difficult political climate of pre-Revolutionary Russia.  It's a more mature and honest, though song-filled piece, more so than the happy-go-lucky musicals of the 50's.	2
760	Annihilation	As if someone had a couple of cool ideas in their head and then came up with just enough scenes to wrap a movie around it. The result is an endless look at this cool and original scene ok next merely glued together with nonsensical drama and generic, soulless and boring filler.	2
761	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Enjoyable mixed bag at best.  At worst, extremely cynical media experience masquerading as a film for the purpose of next quarter's acquisition and merchandising plans.  Good fight and battle sequences, good turns from Luke, Leia, Ren, and (less so) Rey.  The rest...............	0
762	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	I'm not a fan of Seven Psychopaths, and I'm only a little bigger of a fan of In Bruges. For some reason I really felt like I needed to see this movie immediately, and so I dropped everything and saw it. It is 100% worth seeing and is simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious. There are some scenes where the comedy is just over the top and corny, but it only happens a few times throughout. Overall it is a wonderful movie which definitely makes you think. Lots of meaning in here.	2
763	The Shape of Water	It's like Amelie but in the sea. It's like Beauty and the Beast but with mermaids and pickled eggs. It's like Lost in Translation if everything was green and if Bill Murray had fins. It's like Splash but with communism. It's like Last Tango in Paris, but with seaweed.	0
764	My Fair Lady	I could have danced all night.  Clean her up and Audrey Hepburn was very HOT.  Good songs too.  The funniest horse racing scene ever.	2
765	Mother!	During the view I was too unsure about some (possible) metaphors to actually appreciate them, so it was more annoying than reaffirming when I read up on them and saw them confirmed afterwards. Overall an unsettling movie with a message that will not reach everyone properly, but that's not a problem at all. I'll take form over function here, because the message itself is cheesy as hell.	1
766	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	This is not about the shadow of Stanley Kubrick but the bright, burning light of Spielberg's filmmaking genius. Difficult and challenging, it is also profound, extraordinary and visually astounding. Tally it up and you've got a very unusual masterpiece.	2
767	Showgirls	The best melodramatic trash post-Douglas Sirk, Showgirls is a manically funny, sometimes disturbingly stressful, and highly original work of genius, fueled with satire-satirizing-satire that boosts an energy unlike any other film I've seen. It works as a bad movie, when the brain isn't functioning. It works as brilliant craft, when the brain is up and moving. Showgirls is a colorful and intelligent (maybe a bit too intelligent) examination of psychosexual American hypocrisy.	2
768	Red Dawn	As an action film, it's marginal. As a serious drama it's negligible. As a cheesy, gung-ho piece of Reaganist patriotic propaganda, it's fucking Citizen Kane!!! This movie's crap, but for some weird un-explainable reason, if it's on, I wind up watching it.	0
769	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	What a crushing disappointment. Basically a remake dressed up as a new film. Totally wastes the great atmosphere and first-half buildup. Worst aspect was that, in the context of a remake, they had not earned the right to the one major impact scene (those who've seen it will know the scene I mean!) which manages to actually ruin the original series for me. At least episodes I-III tried to be original. This just bottled it, and badly.	0
770	The Staircase	Such an interesting and gripping documentary about a murder case that I almost find it hard to believe that all this actually happened. The insight we get into it all (at least, from one point of view) is unlike any other documentary I've seen about these kinds of cases.	2
771	The Matrix Reloaded	Think of the Matrix. Pretty enjoyable film right? Now imagine it with 50 times as much slow motion which kicks in at all the wrong times in a fight. And add about 45 minutes of pointless, self important, inane philosophy lessons that would take me 5 minutes to explain to my 7 year old nephew. Yet somehow people manage to write entire essays (with, I imagine, a smug look on their face) on the philosophy in this film? GET A LIFE.	0
772	The Jazz Singer	As someone who respects artists who are true to their craft, and who know when to tip their hat to their forbears, (their roots), I have to say I'm thoroughly disappointed - almost disgusted - that Niel Diamond neglected to honour the populist legacy of the original by not using blackface. One can only imagine the improvement it would have brought to Niel's interpretation of the character - it certainly would've lent him more credibility, making him a more waifish type.	0
773	Cosmopolis	A 21st Century horror story, where love, people, death and even money, have no value or meaning. The dialog embraces in  full the unreal and the poetic side of the inhumane, heavy with symbolism, it asks questions and answers them with more questions, and while it may get dense, and intellectually wearing, the final result is one fascinating work. A great tension and stressful vision of a man, and a civilization, reaching total breaking point. Cronenberg's most ambitious and uncompromising wor	2
774	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	9- excellent, awesome :: looked like fun    	2
775	Get Out	Get Out is the most prescient movie that I have ever watched. It does so much. This is the second time I've seen it and it is one of those movies that you want to watch other people experience. Get Out is terrifying in so many ways but the most terrifying moments have less to do with the horror/thriller moments in the movie and more with who we are as Americans. I've never seen a movie with so much bite that is also entertaining as hell to watch. The acting is fantastic and the directing too. 	2
776	The Shape of Water	there's a fish monster man, it's all gross and retarded, and yes, she fucks it.  beautiful movie though, and michael shannon is awesome as always	2
777	Shrek 2	Great series, the besides the great animation actually has a storyline and jokes that people of all ages can enjoy. Man, I can't beelive I'd ever actually use a line like that, but it's true.	2
778	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Hope is like the sun, if you only believe in it when you can see it you won't survive the night. Something along these lines is attributed to Leia Organa in the movie, and it's also a running theme. Rian Johnson's entry into the Star Wars cannon is filled with breathtaking cinematography and a wide range of emotions, but most of all it's very committed to its themes, like freeing oneself from putting too much importance on tradition and lineage, and maintaining hope when none is in sight. 	2
779	Nebraska	Çocuklar toplanın, size öyle iç ısıtıcı, öyle tatlı bir aile hikayesi anlatacağım ki, bunun benzer sorunlu ailelerin toparlanması temalı filmlerin tüm klişelerini, en klişe şekilleriyle kullanarak yaptığımı bile görmezden geleceksiniz. Hem de bunu nasıl yapacağım biliyor musunuz? Siyah beyaz... Evet, VOOOV dediğinizi duyar gibiyim.	0
780	Nebraska	Çocuklar toplanın, size öyle iç ısıtıcı, öyle tatlı bir aile hikayesi anlatacağım ki, bunun benzer sorunlu ailelerin toparlanması temalı filmlerin tüm klişelerini, en klişe şekilleriyle kullanarak yaptığımı bile görmezden geleceksiniz. Hem de bunu nasıl yapacağım biliyor musunuz? Siyah beyaz... Evet, VOOOV dediğinizi duyar gibiyim.	0
781	Avengers: Endgame	This was just too much, I enjoyed the cute ending but was pretty bored through a lot of it honestly. Unlike the first one I felt like I had seen it all before, sometimes literally. This movie has almost zero tension going for it. Most Marvel movies don't but I thought Infinity War was the first time they had actually managed to make me feel stakes so it's a bummer to just not care anymore. A heist was probably a bad route to go for the super saggy middle act.	0
782	Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones	The Romance was so painfully done it was almost impossible to watch	0
783	Beauty and the Beast	Another Disney masterpiece, and again, that's because it's an emotional powerhouse.	2
784	Casablanca	Does it get better than this?	1
785	Grease 2	The closure we all waited for.	1
786	Breakfast at Tiffany's	Luckily Cat was rescued at the end.	1
787	Drive	Tasteless style and poor substance. It's half-brained and silly without meditation	0
788	The Irishman	A rich and tragic culmination of the gangster genre. 210 minutes of incredible acting by three legends, all tightly wrapped up in a bow by arguably the greatest to ever do it. Scorcese is so fucking good, that he averages around 3 bonafide classics every decade since the 1970s.	2
789	Alien	Alien is *the* SF horror movie. If you haven't seen it, it should be first on your list. I first saw this in a theater in Florida, and I literally tore the leather covering off the armrest of my seat at one point in surprise and shock.	2
790	Pleasantville	Only about 10 years old and already a classic. What a delightful film!	0
791	Stalker	Words cannot describe the emonational shock it creates in the right person. Watching this - just like every Tarkovsky piece - you feel so isolated. Anxiety attacks and existential pain.	0
792	Inception	So well done. The way it explains the difficult premise is fantastic. People who like paying close attention will be rewarded. It's just a great blend of suspense, drama, action, and some horror.	2
793	His Girl Friday	The dialogue is amusing, sure, but the actual story is pathetic. The strong heroine turns into a simpering mess at the end and though he's charming, Grant's character isn't likeable. I really thought I was going to like this, but it's kinda awful.	0
794	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	It's Fight Club meets Chinatown. Decidedly among my favorite neo noir after the first viewing, and I love its sense of humor. Highly recommended.	2
795	Zeitgeist: The Movie	I study history. This film is an insult to the study of history; blatantly misleading people and not citing a single source. If you believe a word in this movie you are retarded.	0
796	Fantastic Mr. Fox	visually striking, but ultimately hollow and just kinda dull. there were some funny moments, though- that's just bad songwriting!	0
797	Avengers: Infinity War	Exceeded my expectations. I’m actually not the biggest fan of the Russo Brothers films, so I truly didn’t know what to think about a non Joss Whedon Avengers film. Infinity War is the most epic Marvel movie in scale, and possibly the darkest. It’s thoroughly entertaining and usually gives a decent amount of screen time to each character, although there are a few exceptions. Still the movie is so much fun it’s hard to truly notice small things like this at times.	2
798	Avatar	It's tough to try and roll Apocalypse Now, The Star Wars Trilogy & Starship Troopers into a cohesive film. It's worse when it fails. Make no mistake, Cameron's world he created was gorgeous. Cinematography was spectacular. But the attempt to ball eastern, african and native american philosophy & theology into a unique race failed. The story, with it's lesson of symbiosis between all living things was detracted by bad acting, one-dimensional characters & a predictable storyline.	0
799	Zootopia	Probably a good children's movie, but as an adult, I didn't find it to be enjoyable. The message is solid, but just way too heavy-handed. I didn't need to be constantly bombarded with messages of don't be racist and you can do anything you put your mind to.	2
800	Annihilation	The general plot and the visuals are mindblowing and interesting, but somehow it doesn't deliver as much as it should be. Can be a bad supporting cast, or the director having difficulties keeping up the suspense and the pace. But mostly is the lack of a script focus: it's about a creative destruction of an alien, but also about self-destruction of humans; it's Alien, but not enough suspense; Stalker, but too short and action-filled and character-driven to be Tarkovskij. I'd need a rewatch.	0
801	The Hills Have Eyes	One of the weaker Disney adaptations, Robin Hood is cute and colorful but lacks the majesty and excitement of the studio's earlier efforts.	1
802	Ginger and Rosa	"There are glimpses of a story worth telling and it improves a bit as it goes on, but overall this comes off as contrived and underwritten.
A solid cast, including Elle.F - that seems to be improving with each role - but for all her considerable abilities and talent, she just seems to young to be believable as a 16-17y old - and that's not just because that agegroup usually are being portraited by overaged.
*Preview*: #13#, exp-3*, story, reviews, Elle.F/8-3, Christina.H/7-3, R2."	2
803	City of God	Stylish, entertaining.  Great narrative, fantastic characters.	2
804	The Mummy	I know not that many people like this movie, but i love it. Its not a great movie by any means, but its so damn entertaining that i have to give it a good score.	2
805	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Full disclosure: I love Star Wars. This film seamlessly blends new characters with old and introduces new villains, all while maintaining the spirit of the originals. The plot is a retread, but it works in a film already bathed in nostalgia. I question how some of the Whedon-esque  humor will age, but it worked fine on first viewing.	2
806	The Incredibles	The best bar none Computer animated film. 	0
807	Moonlight	There was a lot of buzz about this movie but I honestly can't understand why. Maybe the style fooled everyone. The director makes a lot of interesting, clever visual choices in terms of lighting and coverage. The acting is mostly great. But what's the story? What did I learn? That bullies beat up quiet kids? That crack addict moms are no good and hard to forgive? This is a movie that shouldn't be tossed aside, but I'm disappointed and felt cheated out of my overpriced movie ticket.	0
808	Cloverfield	What a thrill this movie was. I loved how the movie was directed. 	2
809	You Were Never Really Here	Lynne Ramsay uses powerful images to explore trauma in a really authentic way. Violence isn't glamorised; she lingers on its aftermath and the pain that's underlying it. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible at capturing the subtleties of a really engrossing character study - his torment is offset by tenderness and a determination to rein himself in. It's completely emotionally driven, and you often get the sense that the score is occupying his headspace, filling in for what can't be articulated.	2
810	Suicide Squad	Smith is good, Delevingne is heart-rendingly awful. The rest do what they can with the super-flat characters given them. Plot is wafer-thin. Action scenes are passable.	0
811	A Face in the Crowd	A must-see film for our times, it's hard to believe it is 50 years old. Andy Griffith as a charismatic, but ultimately sociopatchic entertainer. From the beginning you know he is using people, but you also watch him be used by more and more people. He becomes corrupted by power and moves further away from the values he original sang about and ends up as a thing he both hates and loves. Andy Griffith proves in this that he is a masterful actor.	2
812	Halloween	Carpenter very effectively creates horror without the use of a lot of special effects or blood. This film shows what can be achieved with a good story and character development when atmosphere is properly utilized to create tension. Very good film.	2
813	Jaws	Great thriller masterfully directed by a young Spielberg.   Terrifying in a viscerally powerful manner.  Richard Dreyfuss is fabulous.  Robert Shaw's Indianapolis speech chills me to the bone every single time I hear it.  Mows you down at the start & never lets up.	2
814	2001: A Space Odyssey	Sick score, sick visuals, awesome acting, awesome plot. A dream-like experience. A Masterpiece.	1
815	Pan's Labyrinth	Such a great film but so depressing at the same time. Great sets and amazing performance from the cast. 	2
816	Braveheart	Epic. The only word to describe this movie. Mel Gibson does an extraordinary job portraying William Wallace in this classic tale. capturing both the gritty, violent, insane side and the tender, loving, caring sensitive side of Wallace. I cannot recommend this cinematic adventure highly enough. If you are a man and haven't seen this yet, pull down your pants, make sure your dick is still there and then go see this movie!	2
817	The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2	YOU NICKNAMED MY DAUGHTER AFTER THE LOCH NESS MONSTER????!!!!!	1
818	The Raid: Redemption	Mostly entertaining (enhanced by a more than competent soundtrack from Mike Shinoda), but not something that merits more than a single viewing probably. The action eventually seems somewhat samey, such that the films 100 minutes are at least 10 too many. Also, while I don't fault the movie for having what little plot it does, I do fault how flimsy that plot ultimately feels. I wonder if Hollywood can do better...	0
819	Babel	at least some justice for the Arabs, one shot gun by mistake from a kid rang a bell through the whole world and its media and he and his family became terrorists!! and the Arabian government had to sacrifice anything for that so that it can please other government and threw the lambs to the slaughter even if they're innocent.	0
820	Troll 2	They're eating her! ...And then they're going to eat me! OH MY GOOOOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
821	Independence Day	Million dollar budget, five cent script.	0
822	The Lobster	hilarious and deeply disturbing, strangely moving and aesthetically beautiful, the lobster delivers an unique tone that has become trademark with the auter of ''Dogtooth''. the rigorous, oppressive camerawork compliments the themes of institutionization and repression so well that the bits of gallows humor thrown in there become like real air pockets for a viewer drowning in existential horror and awful, systematic loneliness and emotional terror. 	2
823	Christmas with the Kranks	This movie is so bad it makes me want to eat babies.	0
824	Blow-Up	A borderline-perfect piece that works under the surface. In its opening scenes, all the themes are built perfectly--voyeurism, deceptiveness of appearance, excess, perception of reality...and throughout the rest of the film, the protagonist's actions mirror ours as we dissect and attempt to throw ourself into this bizarre circumstance. One of the rare times when the medium of film matches perfectly with the subject it's capturing.	1
825	Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2	Garbage day!	0
826	Predator	Top badass moment? Probably all of it if I'm honest. A dude with cool dreadlocks that wouldn’t look out of place at a ska-punk gig (and probably standing right in front of me given his height), with a built-in atom bomb and VHS quality vision and sound, tries to defeat Earth’s entire supply of testosterone. And fails. By the way, does anyone know what stuff's in that packet that turns you into a sexual tyrannosaurus? I’ve a friend that wants to know. No cats, chainsaws or decapitations.	0
827	The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1	really good 10 out of 10	2
828	Spider-Man: Homecoming	This movie was great fun with very little in the way of downtime. It struck some false notes, but did a great job capturing the Spider-Man ethos without getting bogged down in telling an origin story or actually stating it directly.	2
829	Under the Skin	I just ranked Starred Up as the worst movie I have seen in a while, but I judged too quickly. Under The Skin is the worst movie I have seen in a while... 11/100.	0
830	The Killers	The first scenes, based on the short story, carry a terrifying sense of menace and pacing that the expanded back story, uncovered through an insurance investigation, fails to sustain. But the performances are good, and of course, it is all beautifully shot.	2
831	Easy Rider	The first half drags a bit, although, retrospectively it becomes more interesting, and the editing is brutal. However, taken simply as a counterculture road movie, attacking USA's inability to retain the values the country was supposedly built on, it's a very powerful film. The writing is solid, as are the two leads, and Nicholson livens it up with a show-stealing performance. The photography is great, too, and the psych-rock soundtrack is a perfect companion to the films themes.	2
832	Irreversible	Contains some unbelievably brutal scenes. The story is told in reverse, which hammers home the inevitability of things and makes the final scenes unbearable.	0
833	The Passion of the Christ	I wish more of Christ's life could have been included in this film, but it still stands up. Caviezel does a fine job and the imagery is so well done that it's difficult - if not painful - to watch at times.	2
834	Ghost Rider	Computer animation is just not there yet for this movie. And Nicolas Cage is as cool as his receding hairline.	0
835	The Wolf of Wall Street	It's a surprise that movie which is about drugs, money and hookers can be so boring that at the end you are just left with WHAT?. Poor pacing, long dialogues which give nothing to the plot (so non alcoholic beer doesn't have any alcohol in it?), random voiceovers, a bunch of endings, just going on and on and on like a fucking matryoshka. I love DiCaprio and all of his offbeat heroes, but if you make a 3 hour movie, make it worth watching. It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't Scorsese.	2
836	Oblivion	The first third makes you think you're in for something special and has a pretty sublime moment. Then it turns out you're just in for some pretty above average sci-fi that looks and sounds very good.	2
837	The Notebook	a nice tale of undying love and the great lengths you go to for those you love	2
838	Parasite	Much like Snowpiercer, Parasite has the structure of Class Satire, without actually having anything coherent to say on the topic. The humour is broad and weak, and the surprising narrative twists and cartoon characters cannot support the misguided attempt at gravitas. The movie has no control over its tone. It's a tedious mess, empty, meaningless.	1
839	The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter	This movie is a dentist's nightmare.	0
840	Ed Wood	"Oddly enough in this, my favorite film by him, Tim Burton steps away from the usual dark fairytale mode and goes for quasi-historic drama instead. Fortunately the story is still pretty bizarre... 
 I like the way this film does catch the vigour, spirit and passion of Wood while still making it evident that he was really crap moviemaker. I cannot help rooting for him (and other fringe characters surrounding him) while their failings are obvious..."	0
841	The Life of David Gale	A waste of Spacey.	0
842	American Grindhouse	Robert Forster narrates this primer for Grindhouse cinema that features clips with Landis, Fred Olen Ray, Joe Dante, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Larry Cohen, Jack Hill, and many others interspersed with clips from hundreds of movies. It makes the distinction between exploitation and grindhouse, but with a runtime of only 80 minutes some stuff is given very little time and many subgenres like nunsploitation are completely overlooked. I would like to have seen it at a 3 hour runtime.	0
843	Avengers: Endgame	The best parts are the beginning. Spends a huge amount of time establishing the rules of time travel only to flaunt them (Open portal) in order to bring about another giant battle scene (that looks the same as the one in the previous film). Only one of the time heists (soul stone) brings any drama - the ones with Rhodes and Banner are ridiculously easy - and even when they have to go back to 1970, the face no obstacles after that.  The quiet moments work so much better than all the loud bits. 	2
844	Terminator Salvation	Wow if this movie milked its classic fan base anymore arnold's CGIed nipples would start to hurt. I was briefly absorbed at some points of the movie just barely staying interested until the end with the last lil bit so painfully awful as a fan but also just to cheesy and predictable as a critic. 	0
845	Raiders of the Lost Ark	The Adventure Classic. I know a lot of people are a fan of the ending, but I'm not. 	2
846	The Princess Diaries	Cute premise is squandered by a script that goes in a hundred directions -- none of them remotely genuine -- and never seems to end. Hathaway is appealing, Andrews's touch of class is more than welcome, but the film is an ordeal.	0
847	Closer	Closer is brilliant.It is classy. Nichols is a big chance for actors, he always directs actors very well. Julia Roberts is gorgeous and acted very well, she deserved an Oscar nomination for this. No need to say how Portman and Owen was great.Law is also very successful. Look closer ...	2
848	Sucker Punch	shitty self-esteem lecture with chicks in lingeries fighting the evil. 	1
849	WALL·E	A very sweet movie! Hats off to the sound, animation & all other departments involved, for making me tear up over robots who barely speak, for even without words they convey loads of emotion & thought!  Some people may be turned off by the environmental & lifestyle messages in the movie, but I thought they were well handled and done in a positive way (i.e. - things are fixable).  It's so easy to fall in love with Wall-e - he's absolutely lovable and positive!:D I only wish the movie was longer.	2
850	A Trip to the Moon	Very interesting, fanciful, a bit bizarre, and altogether rather captivating. It must have been amazing seen in 1902. The sets are wonderful.	2
851	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Nearly perfect, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a vibrant and unceasingly entertaining masterpiece. It boasts career-best performances by Val Kilmer and Robert Downey, Jr. Michelle Monoghan is a complete discovery. Shane Black's direction is exciting, and his dialogue is effortlessly cool and ultimately quotable.	2
852	The Thing	there's no other movie which i like so much in the final 5 minutes.  This is THE END ... my dear friend. I'm talking about the last minutes of time-out after all the suspense and action, and monster-things ... MacReady , Childs, bottle of whiskey and : -What do we do now?  -Why don't we just wait here for a little while... see what happens... 	2
853	Crocodile Dundee	I completely forgot that ol Mick molests both a transvestite and an elderly woman until I recently re-watched this	1
854	Interstellar	Overly long, stunning visuals, confusing, tortured, convoluted, waaay too long, awe-inspiring, cliche-filled, fabulous score, pointless, disconnected, run time too long, sappy, weak characterizations, incoherent, exhilarating, and trys too hard to be something, anything at all. Did I mention that this film's run time is far longer than need be? ;)	1
855	It Comes at Night	i'm sooooooooo bored	0
856	The Thing	This is the best horror movie that John ever did. This movie is just so intense and generally scary. Its a great paranoid frozen horror movie...	2
857	Destination Wedding	Unexpectedly great if you're a fan of straight dead-pan humour and a single thin layer of dark existential cynicism over a very sweet love story. Turns out, I am.	2
858	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Episode VI - A Newer Hope. Lucas ignored Gen Xers with the prequels. Now Abrams insults our intelligence by shamelessly pandering. The strong acting and superb throwback special effects just barely buoy this derivative rip off of itself that doesn't have a single original plot line... 	0
859	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	WOW! I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the SW film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a documentary about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story - Whatever were his obstacles, he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every SW fan proud. Pure class. This is a mature and gritty adventure who fianlly dares to leave out all the kiddie stuff in the likes of Episode 1-3 & TFA. Great Score by Giacchino	2
860	Logan	What a surprise. I'm not a superhero film fan, I have basically seen none of the other XMen films...but I am more than satisfied with what I saw. It works well on its own, with some awesome fight scenes that does not shy away from its brutality - which also applies to the also very engaging, dark brooding story that is surprisingly dramatic. Sure, a lot of people fall asleep and wake back up as a plot device, and part of the third act takes a sloooooow halt. But whatever, it's fun anyways.	2
861	Inception	An original movie? A plot that doesn't spell everything out for you? No 'comic relief' character? I'd almost given up hope. Inception is brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed story, switching effortlessly between the emotional drama and Bond level action set-pieces. Flaws? Some of the supporting cast don't get much development as they could, leaving their characters feeling a little thin as a result. Overall though Nolan has created an excellent movie, highly recommended.	2
862	Hard Boiled	Watch it if not for plot or character then the action which is extremely well-done (Woo, the man). Shaky cam, fast editing and glossy cinematography may fool you, but it will never come close to this kind of pure, meticulously choreographed, cinematic splendor... - Saying anymore would automatically spoil awesome Hell no... FUCK YEAH!-moments	0
863	District 9	Overall Enjoyment: 30/40, Plot/Themes: 20/20, Cinematography/Direction: 15/20, Acting/Writing: 15/20    This movie was fantastic. Starts off like a psuedo-documentary and builds into a great narrative and awesome action movie. Some of the best special effects and realistic feeling battles I've seen in a long time. Very fun and engaging experience 	2
864	The Tourist	Johnny Depp's carreer's principle is to act very well in absolutely terrible films. Angelina's carreer's principle is to rely on her beauty and let the audience forget she's supposed to act. This is a movie that combines both.	1
865	Friends	There are few sitcoms I despise more than Friends. There were just so many better shows on at the time, and certainly many better shows on TV now. I find Friends to be not all that funny, that people of my generation started watching because it happened to be on, and in a fit of Stockholm Syndrome declared it to be their favorite show. Not worth my time or anybody else's.	0
866	Meet the Spartans	Very unfuny. While it's prequel Epic Movie was very very dumb, this was just like a water hose of stupid just hosing you down with unfunny pop culture rferences in all the wrong places. Ugh. Don't watch this. Even if you think, Oh I just need to see how bad it is. Not this time, I'm warning you. Though there are some funny parts AFTER the movie.	0
867	Irreversible	i usually get laid on dvd night. not after watching this movie	0
868	No Country for Old Men	Arguably as interesting and enjoyable as it is unsatisfying. Everything about the movie except it's ending dragged me in and begged me to love it. But it does not deliver what the viewer wants in the end. Lacking some important moments, ripping off its burning fuse and preventing any climax, it gives you something interesting, however incomplete, but not what you want.	0
869	Love	...an experiment that works amazingly, and is above all, a rewriting of the possibilities of sex within cinema.	2
870	The Help	The Help certainly has its flaws, but it's far too charming to dislike. The issues of racial tension and civil rights are most definitely covered, but only to an extent. Problems arise, the maids get some quick comedic revenge and then everything goes back to normal. Nothing is completely resolved in the film for most of the characters. It tries to tackle a lot, but it ultimately comes across too lighthearted and watered down.	0
871	Lebanon	This is what cinema is for. For an hour and a half, I was in that tank, I was in that war.	0
872	City of God	Fernando Meirelles' ‘City Of God’ is a Brazillian crime drama film loosely based on real events. This film is brutally realistic and very powerful. The acting from these amateur actors (who probably have never been in a movie before) is great. Very realistic performances set among the dark violent world of the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Shocking and at times hard to watch, this film really smacks you in the face with reality. True events that make you really think of the world we live in.    	2
873	Solo: A Star Wars Story	Solid. Not perfect. Solid.  Going in to Solo with low expectations does it a lot of favors to say the least. It's a pleasant surprise that it turned out to be as adequate as it was. Granted it has some pacing problems and occasionally spends to much time and effort trying to resolve the plot holes and inconsistent writing present in A New Hope. 	0
874	Coco	Every now and then Pixar comes with a animation movie that makes you think and wonder at the imagination of the story-writers. Coco is one such movie. It is almost in the same league as Inside Out. The movie gives you the desired laughs but it also has its tearful moments. The idea of being forgotten from people's memories is brilliantly played out here.	2
875	District 9	An alien race lands in Johannesburg S.A. but cannot leave because their ship is damaged. People took this event not very well and the aliens are cordoned off in a ghetto in the immediate vicinity of their stricken ship. It is in this context that a government agent(who is somewhat racist towards these aliens(as are many people) is exposed to an alien substance which changes him and makes him reconsider his previous attitudes towards the aliens. worth checking out.	2
876	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Wow, this dark, violent ride through the galaxy combines awesome action, great characters and a compelling story with just the right amount of references to the old saga to unleash the familiar Star Wars feeling. Although the outcome is well-known, Edwards manages to blast you away with the strongest Star Wars ending to date.	2
877	The Handmaiden	Fuck the patriarchy!	1
878	Valhalla Rising	This film has value only as an art piece, though even that aspect feels contrived and pseudo-intellectual. As a movie in the traditional sense it is merely ten minutes of gut-wrenching violence followed by two hours of repetitive, albeit beautiful, visuals of what appear to be Scottish mountains. The amazing camera work help make this watchable, but the lack of identifiable characters, terribly unsteady pacing, and utter absence of plot are flaws that no art film can completely overcome.	0
879	Interstellar	If you're looking for a thought-provoking movie, for true art and for philosophy, watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you, however, are looking for CGI and drama..	2
880	Vertigo	Haunting film stays with you for days. More of an experience than a movie, the entire thing seems little more than a dream-- but what a dream. Ending is on par with rest of film that is truly one of the master's greatest works.	2
881	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	Charlie Kaufman is a genius to dream up this movie. It is imaginative, interesting, emotional, intellectual, and audacious. Jim Carrey, who I normally don't like, is wonderfully understated as Joel, and Kate Winslet is his foil in personality and romance as Clementine. Whenever the movie is with them, it is flawless. When it shifts attention to the secondary plotlines, it flags somewhat. The tertiary characters aren't badly written, they just suffer by comparison. A wonderfully thoughtful movie.	0
882	Captain America: Civil War	Finally a really awesome Marvel movie without anything to scream about. Characters are like they should be, the story is great and action is super. If you don't like this, then you probably don't like comics either. Check it out!	2
883	Red Dawn	It is a well known fact that the USSR collapsed when the Soviets realized they could not defeat Patrick Swayze	1
884	Ghost Rider	sam elliot gets points for, well, being sam elliot. the rest blows. i am a huge fan of the original comic and i can't believe this mess is what they managed to compile from it.	1
885	Starship Troopers	Sex, bugs, and lock-and-load. A modern classic B movie.	2
886	X-Men Origins: Wolverine	It would be difficult to make a film that handles this character more poorly than this attempt does. Absolute garbage.	0
887	The Babadook	This is the kind of cutesy indie bullshit your AM talkback listening mother would think is scary. Eye-rollingly contrived, self-satisfied script and distractingly over-cooked, try-hard sets and costumes. Ugly as shit to look at. Ultimately feels like a film made by the worst kind of pretentious, shallow, teachers pet film students who think their work possesses considered gravitas. Doesn't deserve the acclaim at all. Fuck Australian cinema. Watch New Zealand's awesome 'Housebound' instead! 	0
888	The Fly	About a guy who gets into a cool ass machine teleporter thingy, but a stupid ass fly gets in there with him and fucks him over badly. Turns the guy into a big giant fly man thing. In the end we learn it's not cool to be a mutant fly man, and you will die if you are. I always thought if I was eating a biscuit and a fly landed on it and I ate it by accident I too could be a mutant fly guy. Just never got around to it though	1
889	Men, Women & Children	This film understands its subject matter about as much as I understand how Adam Sandler still gets work.	2
890	Men, Women & Children	This film understands its subject matter about as much as I understand how Adam Sandler still gets work.	2
891	Howl's Moving Castle	One of Miyazaki's misses for me. The meandering plot just didn't work well here and Sophie is a dull heroine. I'd much rather watch Howl have magical battles in the sky with the demons than her clean the living room.	0
892	Her	A masterpiece of visual storytelling. The sheer fact that Jonze gets the audience to buy the relationship between Theo and Samantha is beyond impressive. An incredible look into the future.	2
893	Dancer in the Dark	There was more potential in this movie, but at every turning point the director thought, How can I make the sadness more ham-fisted?	2
894	The Blair Witch Project	I don't care how much shit this gets, it was the scariest movie I'd ever seen in theater up to that point.	0
895	Schindler's List	The movie is completely black and white, and I'm not talking simply about the lack of visual colour. In Spielberg's typical fashion, the badguys are unmitigatedly evil, and the goodguys noble, clever and enduring beyond belief. This kind of You're with us or you're Satan-thinking is as reprehensible as it is dangerous. Moralising becomes devoid of reality; the issue isn't that German camp commanders were demons, the problem is that normal people commited atrocities in those circumstances.	1
896	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	The most aggressively mediocre of all the Star Wars movies, and the first time John Williams hasn't been able to salvage something from the mess.	0
897	Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?	I fear how much of the emotion on screen stemmed from their real life marriage, Taylor and Burton realize their roles with horrifying accuracy.  	1
898	Devil's Advocate	Al giveth and Keanu taketh away.	1
899	Begotten	I saw a vagina.	1
900	My Father the Hero	I remember so well when my Dad bought tickets for this movie. I was shocked. But Daad! I dont want to see this movie!  I know, son. We're going to see Drop Zone, and it's rated R.  My Father the Hero. 	2
901	Call Me by Your Name	Let's nominate this movie to show the world we're not homophobic. - The Academy	1
902	The Passion of the Christ	It is amazing to visualize what Jesus went through for us! If you actually saw this, just remember he did that for you.	2
903	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1	This third installment is not inferior to the previous films, just very different. If you pass over a pathetic love triangle, Mockingjay is a piece of social commentary that strikes you with its moral ambiguity. Capitol and District 13 feel perfectly similar; good and evil are indiscernible. A slow pace effectively supports its grim tone and feeling of disillusion; the problem is that the ending is so open and weak that it feels less like a cliffhanger and more like a commercial break.	2
904	He Was a Quiet Man	Visually great black comedy that left me thinking about it a long time before I fell asleep. It's funny and disturbing trip for Slaters character finding himself. Slater is no doubt doing one of his best performances and Cuthbert is also showing us some of her previously unseen skills.	2
905	Django Unchained	Haneke'nin Funny Games'te ters koseye yatirdigi kitle, tam olarak bu ve benzeri filmleri izleyip kanla, cinayetle orgazma ulasarak vayynasini bee, helal ossun! diyenlerdi bana kalirsa. sonunda iyiler kazanip kotuler kaybedince oldurmek, oldurmek olmuyor degil mi. intikam alinip seyirci tatmin edildigi takdirde can alma eylemi, seni nasil da popcorn'unu kemirirken zevkten pis pis siritan biri haline getiriyor degil mi?	2
906	Gravity	'Alone In Space: The Ride,' an ultimate, super-thrilling 3D experience, starring Sandra Bullock as 'Scared Astronaut' and George Clooney as Himself!	2
907	The Box	As a short story, this would have been intriguing and fun. As a full movie, it does not work. The initial concept of the movie gripped me at first. But then I realised half way through that nothing makes sense. By the end, I had more questions than answers.	1
908	Battleship Potemkin	Starving sailors and massacring people on the Odessa harbor steps are not nice things. We hardly need great cinema to convince us of that. The dynamic of Sergei Eisenstein's cinema - of drastic composition and editing fusion - had been displaced by fluidity, movement, and duration. Eisenstein was locking himself into an editing style that was always cutting away and that would never appreciate real time or space. In the history of cinema, he was a dead end.	0
909	The Illusionist	It's a slow movie, but very touching and very real. It's amazing that in the whole movie, maybe a dozen words are uttered. Besides that there is absolutely nothing of dialogue except for some incomprehensible mumbling. Movement, color, body posture and facial expressions are all that director Chomet needs to communicate his ideas. Lovely.	2
910	City of God	I could watch this movie over and over and over again.  Amazingly good.	2
911	Black Swan	The vision that Aronofsky has crafted is an altogether insular affair−the subtlety of the narrative weaves the obsession of perfection into a hallucinogenic nightmare in all its psychological ephemera. The beauty is in the love of the art form, which is precisely why when the narrative swells into such a lovely climax the potency of its effect is clear: The White Swan beautifully transforms into the elusive Black Swan.	2
912	Lilo & Stitch	"If you don't come out of this film wanting to live in Hawaii and own a Stitch of your own, you have no heart. 

The characters and setting lift this up from the usual Disney pablum."	1
913	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Man, did I destroy a piece of my youth when I tried to re-watch this...dull, dumb and actually racist....one of the Arabs speaks Monkey, chrissake! 	0
914	The Killing of a Sacred Deer	Has that slow burn but with zero payoff. 	0
915	The Death of Stalin	Clever ruthless thugs plan a funeral full of yucks, then do some housekeeping (out with the old, in with the old). The one-liners are hilarious, but hard to laugh at sometimes because they catch you mid-gasp. A cautionary tale.	2
916	Solaris	I tried, believe me, I tried. Just couldn't bare with the incredibly slow pacing. The ideas, the shots, everything is perfect, its just so slow and long.	0
917	Bicentennial Man	If they build Robin William bots, I will go on a killing spree.	2
918	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	george threw a dart with his eyes closed and hit the target	1
919	Persona	im not really sure what was going on in this film but i had a boner for most of the time	1
920	Das Boot	Wolfgang Petersons claustrophobic thriller is taut with suspense.Must see!	2
921	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2	I just watched my childhood ride away in that train at the end. I've spend more than half of my life anticipating more Harry Potter: either a book or a movie. And now... Indeed, it all ends. Feels weird and somehow majestic, the end of an era. The film's magical. And it's supposed to be. There's only a single question: what now? where do we go to find the magic?	0
922	Rampage	I just was expecting more from that one. Disappointing but not boring.	2
923	The Thing	A staple of John Carpenter's career (and my personal favourite) that holds up after almost 25 years.  A good psychological horror with a dash of monster and gore with excellent atmosphere.	2
924	Deadpool	was given the wrong expectation that it's consistently funny. it's not, there's a lot of drama and shit but that's good. don't watch any trailers especially cuz there's one that spoils a lot of the jokes that make the movie even better if they're fresh in the context and momentum of the rest of the movie. ryan was great. colossus was dope true to the character. negasonic was awesome. and i love gina. i hope she comes back and has a romance with colossus. also wish they went further with R humour	2
925	Fiddler on the Roof	One of the best musicals ever made, but it's so much more. It delivers life lessons given by characters that you really care about. On the other hand, there is no other hand. 	2
926	On Her Majesty's Secret Service	OHMSS is kind of a proto-Casino Royale in a lot of ways: the way they handle the actor change gives it a sense of rebootiness (although they returned to the old formula in the next movie), and the story takes a break from light-hearted adventuring to explore Bond's character and the toll his job takes on his personal happiness. Lazenby does not deserve the bad rap he gets. (4/5)	1
927	District 9	Loved this.  Great scifi movie.  Plot, effects, distinctiveness - it has it all.	2
928	The Lego Movie	Though jammed pack full of laughs and enough adventure to fill several movies, it never loses focus from its message: never stop being creative. This theme is juxtaposed against a fascist state in which everything is done, literally, by the manual. The movie has a heart and a great sense of wonder about it, and it never gets old seeing objects get thrown together. Backed by an great voice cast, score, witty script, and one of the most ironic songs in a movie, The LEGO Movie is a sight to see.	2
929	There's Something About Mary	Better than a lot of teen comedies, but still in the category.  Fail.	1
930	Avengers: Endgame	I enjoyed this ... it did pretty much everything it set out to do correctly.  It resolved the story ... it closed out a giant series of films in a satisfactory way and provided a lot of fan service without feeling pandering.  It's a big dumb enjoyable film that kind of deserves to be the most commercially successful film ever.  It's certainly not great cinema, but it's hard not to enjoy it. 	1
931	Drive	Technically accomplished but unsatisfying on the narrative and character side. Though a few sequences are spellbinding, it ultimately felt like a somewhat hollow genre exercise.	1
932	Citizen Kane	#1	1
933	The Revenant	After a year of disappointments glad I got to see at least one movie that was truly amazing	0
934	Alone in the Dark	The citizen kane of bad movies!	0
935	Toy Story 4	The story is built around the personal drama of the characters, it's much more an emotional journey  than a fun one. 	1
936	A View to a Kill	Best 80s Bond movie with a nice bad guy (Christopher Walken) and a nice bad girl (Grace Jones). Lots of Action!	2
937	Gravity	The most intense, exhilarating, cinematic experience of my life, bar none.  Breathtaking in the truest sense of the word.  I give it two sweaty palms up!	2
938	Heathers	Pretty adequate dark comedy whose statement isn't as meaningful as it thinks it is. 	1
939	An Inconvenient Truth	Definitely a bit heavy on the apocalyptic messaging, but it needed to be done to get the audience's attention.  The movie does a good job explaining global climate systems for those who have no scientific background.  All in all, a good movie that should serve as a wake up call to society.	1
940	The Last Laugh	One of the most important films in the development of cinema, The Last Laugh, directed by the legendary German expressionist director, FW Murnau, tells the story of a doorman who is being slowly suffocated by the pressures of society and capitalism.  The film incorporates revolutionary filmic techniques including for the first time, the moving camera. Up until this time, int he primitive stage of development, the camera was static. In one scene, the camera spins in circles around the main character, which was revolutionary at the time.  Martin Scorcese used this scene in a homage during his film Mean Streets.  In the end, all the great autuers owe The Last Laugh their due.	1
941	Frankenweenie	An homage is more than just a series of unending, uninspired visual references, right? 	1
942	Heima	An extraordinary documentary, especially for those who miss home, hometown people, innocent times and want to ease the everlasting pain temporarily. It makes you feel cosy, warms your heart. After all, it is Sigur Ros.	2
943	Space Mutiny	Gristle McThornbody, Big McLargeHuge, Buff Drinklots, Bob Johnson, Punch Rockgroin, Roll Fizzlebee!	1
944	Alien: Covenant	Some great acting and nice visuals, but the plot relies on a series of stupid decisions. Apparently John Denver is still popular in 2103	2
945	Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky	In one of cinema's greatest oversights, the annoying fat kid does not get his comeuppance.	1
946	Nekromantik	Left for good. Took the corpse. Wow, that's one hell of a goodbye note!	2
947	House of Wax	You've never seen paris hilton impaled like this	1
948	Un homme qui dort	It's a bit like a Resnais picture - Last Year In Marienbad or something - still, there's an incredible amount of differences. It's undeniably French, in a bad way - at first a couple of minutes in I thought I was going to love it but then when the woman voice over comes in I find myself wanting her to shut up all the time. It didn't quite strike any good notes with me. 	0
949	Kingdom of Heaven	The directors cut is what saves this. The theatrical cut is horrid, but the directors cut is a masterpiece that's marvelously done. 	2
950	The Wizard of Oz	My favorite movie as a five-year-old, and I still love it.  Amazing production, given the time it was made, yet enduringly magical for the story and heart!	2
951	The Void	A bizarre piece of work with nice, bloody practical effects.  More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc	2
952	Castlevania	Surprisingly bad. The animations are nice, but everything else is sub-standard and unsatisfying.	0
953	Wonder Woman	Better than any DC movie since the Nolan batman. Of course, that doesn't say much. A paint by the numbers origin story for the most part with good acting and decent pacing. They do try to turn things on their head a bit with a twist before the film's climax. Although I appreciate the attempt, the twist is thematically problematic. I also wish that the tone was darker, the film fails to communicate the horrors of war that Diana is offended by and all of the villains are comically evil.	0
954	Bohemian Rhapsody	I can't believe they made TV Tropes into a movie.	0
955	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	A huge disappointment caused by the idiotic development of the story. Very provisional treatment of many important characters and secrets and the worst finale of all parts. Great marketing but the very poor effect of the work of such a remarkable cast.	0
956	Pieces	As solid an entry into the slasher canon as there ever was	2
957	Alien	The definitive version of a science fiction/horror classic. The alien is still just as impressive and terrifying as it was in 1979. The entire cast is great, and play their characters very naturally. A refreshing change to see smart characters in a monster movie.	2
958	Fifty Shades of Grey	A cultural event - but pretty low grade entertainment. Some erotic tension - but not much else. If I wanted to read a stream of emails, I would not go to to a film. The worst thing about it is it seems set for a sequel.	0
959	Pacific Rim	This movie isn't heavy on character development or plot, but it has giant robots and monsters fighting it out in really cool ways. Don't go into it expecting something deep, and you'll probably enjoy it, especially if you're inclined to like giant robots fighting monsters anyway.	1
960	Equilibrium	Don't touch my fucking puppy.	1
961	The Blair Witch Project	Ooooh, we're out in the woods. We're out in the woods. We're dribbling snot all over the place. We're out in the woods. It's dark and there is a sea of snot. We're out in the woods. We're in a creepy structure. We all drop out cameras when teacher tells Bobby to stand in the corner. End of movie.	0
962	Duck Soup	Not funny at all. Much of this material was borrowed by other later comedians and cartoonists. My first Marx Brothers movie. Will be the last. Groucho insults everyone for no reason. Harpo pulls mean tricks behind other character's backs. Chico tells really really bad jokes. Zeppo plays straight man. Cap stone of this horror show was the racist joke about the origins of black people, euphemistically referred to as darkies. This period of cinema should be an embarassament to everyone involved.	0
963	Avatar	A boundless chimeric achievement of visual splendor. The world of Pandora is filled with life, wonder and unforeseen beauty; in many respects it harkens back to the romantic notion of being one with nature. Nevertheless, the clumsy writing, one-dimensional characters, and cliche plot about an embroiled war pitting man versus nature weakens its strong suits. Moreover, the silly pantheistic, environmental and anti-capitalists undertones reduces the overall appeal and effectiveness of the film. 	2
964	Pan's Labyrinth	Such perfection, such greatness, such beauty, such horror. Such is the word, such is a film.	2
965	The Princess and the Frog	The art in this film is pure magic and the fact that it is set in New Orleans makes me love it even more. A lovely return to 2D for Disney.	2
966	Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	What makes this the best Star Wars movie?  I can at least throw out some ideas: the beautiful, stark landscape of Hoth, Pray that I don't alter it any further, my favorite twist ending of all time.  I can't pinpoint it, but this movie is an absolute joy from beginning to end.	2
967	The Secret World of Arrietty	I loved every-single-detail. Well-animated as usual, creative, the Ghibli trademarks, i.e. animals (cat!!!), nose forms, faces are well-known friends from other Ghibli movies, giving a feeling of comfort to me as a Miyazaki fan. I especially liked music in the end fit the movie incredibly well, it definitely gives the movie a bittersweet taste with a mixture of peace and sadness, so is life... Overall, not a Miyazaki masterpiece, but still a wonderful Ghibli movie and definitely re-watchable.  	2
968	Shoot 'Em Up	Just to give you a taste, the first kill in this film is done by carrot, which Clive Owen shoves into some guy's mouth, followed by a firm wallop that sends the vegetable through the henchman's brain stem. The action is followed by Clive Owen suggesting that the freshly murdered henchman eats his vegetables. If that sounds up your alley, then there is no better film for you. 	0
969	Primer	For those who can accept that mutliple viewing, complex  charts, and discussions are really the only way to experience this, its a interesting movie.	2
970	Mission: Impossible - Fallout	Tom Cruise. God among men.	1
971	Air Force One	Wow! USA president is stealth swat superman! He rescues his family, USA, the whole world!!!! And Americans are watching this? Americans are stupid!	1
972	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	Stylistically, the closest any film has ever come to immersing the viewer into the pages of a comic book. The trailers don't do this flick justice; it definitely exceeded my expectations.	2
973	Scream	A highly entertaining teen slasher with some nice satire of the genre thrown in. 	2
974	The Game Plan	Spoilers: The Rock is allergic to cinnamon.	0
975	Uninvited	The Uninvited has some great acting by the lead actress (Ji-hyun Jun ) and its integration of the puzzle pieces from the start is cleverly done. However, it doesn't seem to firmly decide what it wants to be until the last 40 minutes or so due to very slow pacing. Nonetheless, the cycle of misery that plagues the protagonists makes for some interesting insight into the way we deal with relationships. Overall, the promise was there and it did deliver but the delivery was a little lacking.	0
976	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	A largely ineffective collision between rude humor and hamfisted emotional manipulation.  Dramatic bits  are overplayed and on-the-nose, everyone crying and yelling for the cheap seats.   McDonagh is an acclaimed playwright but his ear for US redneck vernacular seems off.  His blunt dialogue sits awkwardly in the mouths of a mostly distinguished cast.  McDormand delivers a cringeworthy speech to a deer.  Landry Jones, a distractingly mumbly actor anyway, can barely be understood here.	0
977	Do the Right Thing	Spike Lee has to be the most arrogant and condescending director out there. Here he's shoving his opinions about race conflicts down people's throats, and if you don't agree with him, then you must be racist.	0
978	Ben-Hur	This film is actually a remake of a 1925 film.  Ex-General Lew Wallace wrote this during the time when he was territorial governor of NM.  It's a great book and it had the potential for a great movie - which director Wyler accomplished.  All the top cast, though constrained by the dialog constraints of a Biblical epic, really do their parts well.  It's a great effort on many levels - drama, action, a love story and how heroism can be felt and displayed.  An awesome and still impressive movie!	2
979	The Tree of Life	Where do I start? It's a visually stunning movie, maybe the most beautiful waste of energy I've ever seen. It spends waaay too much time trying (I presume) to tell the storyline with abstract art and random pictures with choral music, but fails miserably in telling a coherent story. The most pretentious crap I've ever seen. Acting is great, and like I said, it's all very beautiful, but that's just about the only positive here. Watch some fireworks with soothing music for 2 hours instead.	0
980	Get Out	Brilliant movie Feels like this could possibly happen   Favorite scene when mom hypnotized him and in my mind I'm thinking no....he's just playing along Then you realize she got him....It's a totally mind blowing moment but in the best possible way !	2
981	Scream	Definitive restart to the teen slasher genre brought to the screen by horror giant Wes Craven and horror screenwriter Kevin Williamson.  Great ensemble cast with some excellent performances.  A horror must see!	2
982	Her	This is what cinema is for	1
983	The Kingdom		1
984	Gravity	Incredible. The visual magnificence, excellent soundtrack, and masterful storytelling combined to create one of the most intense cinema experiences of my life.	2
985	Alien: Covenant	Alien: Covenant is predictable and less thought-provoking than any other film in the series, but still manages to entertain.	2
986	John Wick: Chapter 2	I didn't like the fantastical world building of the otherwise relatively grounded first movie, this one leans into it and somehow comes out better for it.  The hall of mirrors is good but should have slowed down to let it breathe some.  I would have like a much longer spackling scene also.  The generic assassins get dispatched in repetitive ways, they should be fewer in number and more creatively handled.  The bullet proof is dumb, though the alternative would be to give the goons worse aim.	0
987	Pacific Rim	The plot is nothin special, the actors are all okay (excepting Idris Elba and Ron Perlman) and the music is acceptable, but the action/monster design is top notch. I saw Pacific Rim because it promised giant robots fighting giant monsters and it delivered that a billion times over. Awesome special effects.	2
988	300	To much yellow, to much exaggeration for a fantastic movie and defective screenplay, no deepness or details  of the affair. Unnecessary demagogy about freedom and democracy.	1
989	Lilo & Stitch	Possibly the most unusual and otherwise unique Disney film ever to be made.  For once reflecting the reality of families today--that we could lose each other at any point, and so we should treasure every moment.	2
990	Sátántangó	An absolutely stunning cinematic experience that in my opinion every film lover should undergo at least once in their lives. The opening scene with the cows serves as a dark prophecy of what the viewer is about to witness; I encourage everyone not to be intimidated by the 7.5 hr. runtime and to climb this mountain; because this is the Mount Everest of modern film-making.	2
991	Ex Machina	"Four characters. Postcard-esque outdoor shots - lush green, white snow and frothy water contrasted with marvelous indoor set design produces a tense atmosphere. Suitably assisted by beautiful light effects, lyrical music and most importantly a neatly woven, solid scifi plot, pondering on ethics and perils of artificial intelligence.

The philosophical discussions were well put and the climax is shocking. Although not a novel concept, a novel movie - bold in making and audacious in scope."	2
992	The Tree of Life	Clumsy, even ludicrous in parts. In others lightyears ahead of anything else I have ever seen in cinema. And that is just after one viewing. Edit: Criterion Extended Cut + Acid. Different beast.	0
993	Event Horizon	Fear the black eyes. Best sci fi horror since Alien.	2
994	Beyond the Hills	Asks some important questions about the religion, life and friendship, yet I can't help myself but think all these Romanian filmmakers produce films only to inform us how the things are shitty in Romania both in Ceausescu and post-Ceausescu days. The leading ladies deserve a mention.	2
995	Fiddler on the Roof	The greatest film musical of all time, a powerful tale of tradition versus progress, of parents and children, of love and struggle.  Absolutely beautiful to look at.	2
996	Before Midnight	I am somewhat ambivalent about this last instalment in the 'Before'-trilogy. The writing and acting are, yet again, excellent, and I have no trouble believing that the events in this movie follow naturally from the previous movies. The writers opted for a naturalistic approach (romance basically turns to kind-of-but-not-total shit) and while this may be a brave choice, I also found myself asking why I subjected myself to the kind of frustrating discussions I'd rather avoid in real life.	2
997	Schindler's List	to say it with the caustic words of kubrick (and he got the right to say that, look for aryan papers): the holocaust is about 6 million people who died, not about a few hundred who lived.. even though it's a good movie.	0
998	Bridge of Spies	Just a really solidly good movie. Spielberg's masterful direction, the Coens' masterful writing, and Hanks' masterful acting all come together really nicely. Like Shutter Island and the Truman Show, it's not an amazing feat of film-making, and it won't change any lives, but it's a really really good movie.	2
999	The Diving Bell and the Butterfly	Photography is good. Direction is excellent, artistically dense, creative - so creative that even the creatively above avg Hollywood productions seem crass. (Considered together with Amelie, it is like the French are a separate class of artistically/creatively superior people. Can imagine neither of the films produced elsewhere). The writing has poetic epiphanies that seeds a deep desire inside you to read the original work. Overall one of the best films I have seen. 	2
1000	Whiplash	I enjoyed the intensity and the acting,great directing in that respect but the character development=0.What's the teacher's story,what's the girlfriend's story ..?Andrew is under the same pressure as the other students and no-one is as appalling as he is so why am I supposed to feel anything for him.And honestly,that cheesy final act with that glimpse between the teacher and the main character...OK so we're friends now or what? Reading all the raving reviews, my high expectations were not met.	0
1001	Stalker	Long slow pretentious and boring	0
1002	Mulholland Drive	The master of moods tells a tale about a country girl in Hollywood in a way only few can. The only movie in existence to destroy any and all competition within its genre. This is the very definition of mystery.	1
1003	2001: A Space Odyssey	"Who's Man, exactly/
Are we apes smashing old bones?/
Or children of stars?/"	1
1004	The Unborn	This stuff is scary in the same way that twelve random ingredients from your kitchen is soup.	0
1005	Willow	I'm sorry, but we can't be friends if you don't like Willow.	0
1006	A Serious Man	No jews were harmed in the making of this film.	1
1007	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Boring.  What a complete mess of a film.  Out of place slapstick humor, a stupid plot that doesn't make sense, simple and uninspiring dialogue, forgettable music, an obviously contrived diverse cast to make the social justice warriors happy, and don't forget that rich people are evil.  This is the death of Star Wars.  What comes after may wear the same clothes, but has none of the soul, depth, and imagination.	0
1008	Beauty and the Beast	If you can't enjoy this, I don't think we can be friends.	0
1009	You're Next	Alternately disturbing, intense, and funny, You're Next is the best horror movie I've seen in theatres. It stands out by being very realistic: the assailants don't have superhuman pain tolerance, the victims don't follow horror movie cliches like trapping themselves in a corner, and the explanation for the killings  is sound. The humor of this movie cannot be understated, as it's needed to not come off as nihilistic, and it is funnier than most self-described comedies.	1
1010	Beauty and the Beast	If you can't enjoy this, I don't think we can be friends.	0
1011	The Color Purple	My favorite movie of all time, this flick is truly epic.  It doesn't score a full 100 only because it seems a little choppy towards the end, but it is rather long and ran the risk of overkill without SOME editing.  How could this movie be nominated for eleven...ELEVEN...Academy Awards and walk away empty handed?  It's a damn shame.	0
1012	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	Great action, special effects that still hold up after all this time.  Corny at times but it's a lot more than can be expected from most action movies.	2
1013	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Cringe-worthy shameless nerd pandering garbage. Dull characters, poorly paced and terribly written, the only positive to be found here is the somewhat decent cinematography which gets it a 1 rather than a 0.	0
1014	Electrocuting an Elephant	Edison: Look what a terrible invention Tesla has made! One so heinous that it poses a threat to our very lives. What will happen if it falls in wrong hands? Like mine?	0
1015	Wonder	I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. It had a bit of humor and a bit of heart. If I were to rate on enjoyability alone, I'd probably rate the movie higher. However, the movie was pretty formulaic and didn't take any risks, which I think a movie like this should do, especially considering the all-star cast. Very predictable ending so I took some points off for that.	0
1016	It Chapter Two	first of all I couldnt hold my face straight when the kids were on, I luv them, cant believe how talented kiddos they are. 	2
1017	Slow West	Now that's the kind of western I could get behind. Harsh, unforgiving, melancholic but also absurdly entertaining. It's got the Coen brothers dark humor vibe. And anything can be improved by a touch of dark humor. I always thought Fassbender was a fine actor but this made me realize how charismatic he is. Might be the cowboy gear.	2
1018	The Prestige	Nolan has created a stylized period atmosphere with a sense of 'magic' in the air. There are problems with the ending, especially the stretch and explicitness of it. But overall it is a wonderful and smart experience with good acting.	2
1019	Showgirls	At least there was lots of nudity.	1
1020	Under the Skin	You are either going to love or hate this film. I found it incredibly dull that had nothing in its plot to captivate its audience. It felt like I was watching some student art film who just got lucky that one of Hollywoods biggest stars agreed to play the lead role. The only reason people will talk about this film is because Scarlett Johansson gets completely naked in a scene. Mostly you will end up questionning why you have wasted 108 minutes of your life watching it.	0
1021	Avengers: Endgame	There is almost everything you would ever wanted to see. And this is enough. Take your time, hold your breath and thanks marvel for ten amazing years.	2
1022	Avengers: Endgame	If you're expected to tie together 20+ prior films with a giant list of characters, you'll feel bloated & come with plot holes but it still pulls the rest off well. The theatre was at the edge of their seats as this packs a heavy emotional punch throughout while still containing good action & visuals with balanced humour. Can't really ask for a global blockbuster superhero movie to do any more than that in 2019.	2
1023	The Prestige	"Wow!!! Why does someone who can make movies like The Prestige & Memento waste his time with comic book movies.
  This is one of my top 10 movies."	0
1024	The Big Lebowski	Requires at least two viewings to really enjoy.  This movie is almost endlessly quotable, especially if you have a friend named Donny.  I don't but I wish I did.  	2
1025	Eighth Grade	This movie is to middle school what Come and See is to World War Two.	1
1026	Guardians of the Galaxy	Beat-for-beat a silly Phantom Menace in traditional, rote superhero movie structure, but is elevated by nuanced characters and world-building	2
1027	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Thoroughly enjoyable although I found myself connecting to it emotionally and so I had to pull back which detracted somewhat from my enjoyment.	2
1028	12 Monkeys	One of those movies that keeps the viewer on his toes all the time. You can never be sure what to believe and what is real or imaginary. Even after the end of the movie there's no certainty about what really happened.	0
1029	Arrival	Stylish and well acted but let down by breaking the golden rule of time-travel stories: the mechanics must be internally consistent. Sapir-Whorf isn't quite able to bear the weight put on it here.  After late reveals in Enemy and Prisoners, Villeneuve should be careful not to become an upmarket Shyamalan.	0
1030	The Shining	Jack Nicholson carries this Kubrick horror flick.  There's nothing wrong with this movie except Shelly Duvall's teeth.	0
1031	Goodfellas	Flawless in every respect: gripping story, pacing, acting, style, sheer entertainment, it's got it all.	2
1032	Inception	Mindfuck at many levels. Even if there are plotholes, it has sufficiently complexity and finesse to take your mind off it. The action is slick and not overdone, while the CG is masterfully done. Even with the eye-candy, there are strong plot and characters to support it. Immersive from the beginning to the end, and you're left wondering: Is this reality or am I dreaming? 	2
1033	The Terminator	A nice movie about a robot who just wants to follow his dreams despite the real world trying to stop him at all costs.	2
1034	Dream House	Worst dad acting I've ever seen and I watched Real Steel the other day.	0
1035	Snow White and the Huntsman	So boring. Charlize Theron is the only one who shines through this mess. I was actually rooting for her throughout the movie! Ugh, and can't someone just fire Kristen Stewart from her acting job, please? For good?	0
1036	Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones	Chappelle, Stanhope, and Gervais are the only well known comedians left willing to risk it all, speak honestly, and find the humor in the dark and untouchable, just as Carlin and Pryor did before. Was this special consistently funny? No. It needed edited. Some jokes were poorly crafted, while the show itself had too much dead space. However, at this point in time I'd rather see someone at least make an attempt to challenge minds. A great non-malicious rebuttal for today's easily offended culture	0
1037	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	The tone was all over the place.. pointless scenes.  Yuck yuck humor. I felt like I was watching Austin Powers-like farce in places.  Mark Hamill went full camp in the tree scene.  All while against a LONG clock lets them travel the galaxy to find what they need. Take in the sights, play a few slots, then oh ya get back and save the day only to not and go off on another mission.  Oi. Makes me appreciate the prequels much more.  A total mess.  	0
1038	Kader	... basimda bir cocuk; kalk abi kars'a geldik. otobusden indim, yurumeye basladim. dedim allahim ben nerdeyim?, burasi neresi? sonra guc bela burayi buldum, kapinin önunde durup dusundum, dedim bekir, bu kapi ahret kapisi, burasi sirat köprusu. bu sefer de gecersen bir daha geri dönemezsin. iyi dusun dedim. dusundum, dusundum ama olmadi. dönemedim. sonra bak oglum dedim kendi kendime, yolu yok cekeceksin, isyan etmenin faydasi yok,kaderin bu. yol belli, basini eg usul usul yuru simdi ...	1
1039	Se7en	Se7en is one of the essential films of the 90s. It redefined the horror genre and established new techniques and conventions that shocked the public. It's a disturbing film which has poignancy in its core, but I wouldn't recommend to the faint of heart. It's grisly and graphic, but the gore is necessary for the film. It instantly became one of my favourites and I think it could easily pass as my favourite. An excellent thriller that will be recognized as revolutionary for years to come.	0
1040	Scream of Fear	I generally don't like Hammer much, but this didn't feel like one of their films at all. Anyway, thought it was well-written and acted and felt quite ahead of its time. Despite having a predictable and over-used story, it kept things feeling fresh and suspenseful.	1
1041	Quadrophenia	I'll never forgive Leslie Ash for the way she treated poor little Jimmy.  And didn't Sting look amazing before he became a bell-end.	0
1042	Noah	Aronofsky has Jumped the Ark.  	1
1043	La La Land	Bitter-sweet and totally captivating. On the surface it works for romantic movie suckers, but it has an unusual amount of depth. It's also freaking gorgeous to look at, super colourful, and has wonderful set pieces.	2
1044	Youth	You only think you know blunt, until you see this. If that's not enough to get you going, Sorrentino had re-invented a whole new level of banality and blatancy for this movie alone. He doesn't trust his audience to think, you see, thus he makes sure to put his symbolic scenes and alegoric dialogs straight into your face oh so elegantly. This leads to Miss Universe being the smartest chick in the movie by far, for she didn't speak much or maybe because she had big boobs, can't remember which now.	0
1045	Shrek 2	It may not be as fresh as the original, but topical humor and colorful secondary characters make Shrek 2 a winner in its own right.	2
1046	The Colony	A thoroughly enjoyable chiller about the last humans alive trying to survive the next ice age. Nothing new but doesn't try to be and so doesn't fail. They could have kept the story going a little bit longer and given it a more fulfilling conclusion.	2
1047	Avengers: Infinity War	If you have watched nearly every MCU film thus far, and are already emotionally invested in the characters, then this might be the movie for you. Otherwise, prepare for a very long film where a bunch of characters you don't care about fight over some random sounding mcguffins for reasons that are explained in movies you didn't watch. I have seen a fair number of MCU movies, but apparently not enough of them . . .	0
1048	GoldenEye	Revitalizes all the classic Bond elements: James has a real emotional arc. His relationship to M gains depth. The Bond girl is strong-willed and independent. The action scenes are creative and now feels natural in the narrative. Sharp cinematography. Even the puns are above average. Brosnan manages to display the confidence of Connery, the elegance of Moore and the ruthless edge of Dalton. The result is the ultimate Bond movie. Sadly the next 3 movies would never approach this level of quality. 	2
1049	Ex Machina	Quite surprisingly, Ex Machina isn't all effects over substance, as so many of its ilk are these days. It's full of interesting ideas. When it comes down to it, the movie is about humanity's god complex. It's a deftly told tragedy that leaves the viewer with more than a little to think about.	1
1050	Ex Machina	Quite surprisingly, Ex Machina isn't all effects over substance, as so many of its ilk are these days. It's full of interesting ideas. When it comes down to it, the movie is about humanity's god complex. It's a deftly told tragedy that leaves the viewer with more than a little to think about.	1
1051	The Kings of Summer	Loved it. From start to finish. It s that simple sometimes.	2
1052	Cat on a Hot Tin Roof	Greatest dialogue scenes ever, great actors. A true classic. 	2
1053	A Quiet Place	I liked this so much. Well, like, it's a complicated word. Got me averting my gaze, crouching, curling up in a fetal position, clutching the hand of my friend. Afraid to make any sound. This was so tense and intense. And not only was the sound expertly deployed, but the family dynamics were, beautiful, touching and detailed. I love what the camera can do without that many lines. And how much meaning you can find in silence and gazes and touch.  	2
1054	The Mummy	For my money, The Mummy delivers exactly what it promises: Indiana Jones-like adventure with just the right mix of comedy and horror.  There should never have been any sequels.	0
1055	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Every Star Wars Aspect of it was great. Everything else not so much. Sometimes I wanted to close my eyes and return my mind to the wide ether of the force but then something fantastic happened and I was hooked again. It's a shame they wasted so much screentime on boring stuff that ultimately was just...there. Sad.	1
1056	Mad Max: Fury Road	It's a really well executed action flick.  I was expecting some retro elements but the visuals are very 2015, though with mercifully limited use of disorienting CGI track & pan shots during the action.  The world Miller creates is fascinating and the script does an outstanding job of selectively explaining things.  Best of all, we get to experience it with excellent pacing.  I can't remember the last time a two hour runtime flew by so fast.	2
1057	The Devil Rides Out	Charles Gray (as leader of a demonic cult) and Christopher Lee (the knowledgeable hero) are the two great leads which make this film the exciting satanic thriller that it is, Lee especially giving a commanding performance in every scene he's in. The effects may not stand up nowadays but the sense of menace, well paced storyline and great acting performances certainly do... and it's nice to see education being more useful than brawn for once too!	2
1058	Aliens	Sci-fi Horror gold, the xenomorph has stalked my nightmares for almost two decades.	0
1059	Moulin Rouge!	Soppy, corny, cheesy, completely over-the-top- it's audacious in its flashiness. But it's also hard to dislike a film that is this much fun. 	0
1060	Mortal Kombat: Annihilation	Worse than the first one and that's pretty bad.	0
1061	Moulin Rouge!	Soppy, corny, cheesy, completely over-the-top- it's audacious in its flashiness. But it's also hard to dislike a film that is this much fun. 	0
1062	Alice in Wonderland	13-9-2010 visuals ok, rest is a terrible mess. rating it just to remember never to watch it again	0
1063	The Alphabet	It's like a rejected Sesame Street short!	0
1064	Inception	The genre High-Concept Thriller is thrown around too loosely sometimes and causes you to draw comparisons to classics like Bladerunner. Inception does not disappoint. Nolan delivers an intriguing premise and builds upon it beautifully, in every sense of the word: it's gorgeously shot, wonderfully choreographed, deeply engaging and thrilling from the word go. The twists were a little predictable, but this doesn't prevent this work of art from being potentially the best film of the decade.	2
1065	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	What else can be said that hasn't already?  The film score is the greatest in movie history, the special effects represented a quantum leap forward, it made mainstream stars of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and James Earl Jones, it introduced the singular villain in screen history...it's the single biggest film of all-time.	2
1066	Frequency	A well-made thriller. The thriller plot and the time traveling theme really go well with each other.	2
1067	Jurassic World	A girl who loses her clothes during the story but becomes more and more sweaty, an alpha male with way too much testosteron and a badass dinosaur. All in 3D! It was hilarious awfull...	0
1068	Lucy	So much stupidity condensed in just 83 minutes. It's kind of impressive.	0
1069	Alice in Wonderland	Too much cgi makes Tim a dull boy.	0
1070	Pacific Rim	Oh lordy, those mechas!!!! Felt like it's Christmas while watching!	1
1071	Mr. Nobody	Take the worst of Cloud Atlas, Benjamin Button, Many-worlds theory, and Brent Spiner playing Noonian Soong on Star Trek and you get this mess. Cut the parts of the teenage Nemo wholesale. Nemo Nobody are you kidding me? Why don't you just name the guy Hiro Protagonist FFS. I hope nobody is praising Leto's acting in this one though he does appear to make a good canvas for prosthetics and argyle.	0
1072	Foodfight	Maybe the ugliest film I've ever seen, visually or morally. Literally compares serving children healthy foods instead of sugary cereals advertised by cartoon characters to the Holocaust. And when coupled with the strangely sexualized female characters, this film takes commodity fetishism to new heights.	2
1073	The Shaggy Dog	Ruf! I understand Tim Allen doing this movie. It plays into his Santa Clause audience. But, what were Robert Downey Jr. and Danny Glover thinking? Seriously.	1
1074	Birdman	Rarely have I seen an intelligent movie so dull and unengaging. Isn't satire supposed to be aggressive? Or funny? The main plot is rote, the sub plots are truncated, and the characterizations are blunt and shallow. Working out the logistics of the long takes can be fun, but that's about the greatest joy this flick has in store. To me, the movie amounts to nothing more than a technical gimmick propped up by some fine stunt casting and a whole lot of hot air. I vastly preferred Synecdoche, NY.	2
1075	Roma	Introducing Italian Neorealism (in Spanish) to the Netflix audience! Not as monumental or heavenly as most critics claim but still it's beautifully-crafted.	2
1076	The Prestige	I'm completely on board now, when people say: This is a GREAT movie! *Fantastic	2
1077	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Yeah it's pretty much crap. 50 (70) for being SW.	0
1078	Avengers: Infinity War	This is the perfect Popcorn Movie. I can't really describe how overwhemeld I was after I left the Cinema but you should watch it. Watch it and love it.  The whole thing they builded up over so many years and movies comes to a big conclusion and it hits the spot just right.  Thanos is the best villain I've seen in years and he lives up to the expectations. This movie is dramatic and not just your tipycal comicbook-movie but really full-ass grown, with suspense and oh shit i ran out of characters.	2
1079	Ex Machina	Great sci-fi film covering Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics with great zest and care. The film is really quite simplistically made pretty much all in one location. The stars of the film really shine as they become fully immersed in their well thought out roles. The music throughout is also quite fitting and even used to add a little humour.	2
1080	I, Tonya	Margot Robbie is a blast. The movie itself is as much a black comedy as it is a biography. Very well made.	2
1081	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood	In many ways more restrained and refined than any of Tarantino’s films from the 2000s. There’s less irritating exploitation of blatant entertainment than in his previous films. Also, Once upon a time in Hollywood is a decent depiction of the end of the 1960s, even with a bunch of obvious clichés.	2
1082	Ant-Man	Lots of fun. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. Edgar Wright left the project before its completion, but you can see his fingerprints everywhere. The absurdity of the situations, the genre movie (it is mostly a robbery flick, not a superhero one), some of the dialogs. I'd love to see ant-man in different secnarios and I can only imagine what the movie would look if Wright stayed to the end.	1
1083	Avengers: Endgame	I'm sure if I analyzed it further as a film you could find flaws, but as a culmination to 11 years of comic book movies and continual storytelling, this movie is pretty perfect. It gets more comic booky than any of the previous movies did.	2
1084	The Third Man	This fucking movie, my god. Best entrance ever made by a character mid-film. The cinematography/lighting is so self-aware, and a great nod to Lang. Joseph Cotton and Welles once again prove to be quite a team. You can completely see the last scene in the movie coming but you're still impressed.	2
1085	Spirited Away	A beautiful movie from the powerhouse Studio Ghibli, I consider Spirited Away to be one of the best animated films of all time. The art is beautiful, the story is flawless and full of hidden surprises that you only notice with repeated viewings. A definite must-see.	2
1086	Swing Vote	WOW  That was terrible  plus, what is up with both presidential candidates always wearing red Ties?!?!	2
1087	Inception	Awesome multi-layered thriller, best to come to the big screen for a while. Kept surprising you all along, with the good plot and excellent visuals. Loved it.	2
1088	The Fly	The science is soft, but my goodness was I hard.	2
1089	2012	It all looks rather expensive and some sequences are downright apocalyptic, but 2012 fails miserably at portraying anything resembling true human emotion. Emmerich is a grand technician but a terrible director; any moment that is supposed to be big and horrifying ends up being absolutely laughable. It's a whole big bag of neat visual effects and nothing else. Roland, you need to understand that huge disaster flicks need true drama in order to work, not crack abysmal jokes every 5 minutes. Next!	0
1090	Oldboy	"Superbly made Korean film which is beautifully shot, acted, written and directed and contains all the elements for a masterpiece.

Stunning film

*One of my favourites*"	2
1091	Braveheart	Mel Gibson's pinnacle! A great depiction of a historical epic that should be mentioned in one breath with Ben Hur and Spartacus. Epic battles, epic speeches, and an epic ending to inspire. 	2
1092	Black Swan	Wow. Yes, the screenplay is weak. I couldn't care less. I haven't seen a film this visceral in years, maybe ever. Portman is more than just career-best in one of the most difficult film acting assignments ever; this is one of the all-time great performances. Perfectly captures the weird dichotomy of the deathly serious and the absurd that any obsessive artist confronts themselves with on a daily basis. A dizzy, demented film that doesn't give a damn about the line between reality and delirium.	1
1093	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	A picture of sheer originality, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a emotionally engaging, thought provoking picture of the highest quality.    	2
1094	Eyes Wide Shut	A too-old Stanley Kubrick put out this ponderous, dark, unbelievable and bizarre movie. Maybe stuff like that really does go on....nah. I don't think so. Nicole Kidder in glasses and panties is the high point of the movie.	0
1095	Snowpiercer	Lots of great ideas thrown around and rather exciting, but it's so full of plot-holes and inconsistencies, and so badly edited, that it ends up being disastrously stupid. It does take some risks and for that I give it some credit, but that doesn't save this movie.	0
1096	Eastern Promises	Cronenberg HAS to start writing his own scripts again. Even more disappointing than the previous one, this has so many implausible twists and turns it becomes quite ridiculous, perhaps intentionally. Aside from the infamous violent scenes, there's no real reason to watch this, and I'm still waiting for that once great director to find his new path in a more satisfying way.	0
1097	Pan's Labyrinth	Pan's Labyrinth is a unique amalgam of the dark side of both Spanish history and fantasy. The special effects and suspenseful storytelling are superb. As much as I enjoy this movie, I find repeat showings difficult because of all of the emotions the viewer is subjected too. Also, everything CREAKS. 	2
1098	True Romance	a chick flicks for boys	1
1099	The Last Dragon	Not quite Blaxploitation and not quite Kung Fu, this isn't a movie you watch for the fight scenes, acting or storyline. You bathe in the music, the one liners, and spectacle of it all and smile. Asians who want to be black and blacks who want to be Asians, a neighborhood shogun, a pizza parlor, a dance club, a hack entertainment agent and the mystical power of The Glow all come together in a ridiculous bit of 80's spectacle that is impossible to reproduce. Lose the attitude and enjoy yourself.	0
1100	Akira	A story of completely epic proportion. It can only be portrayed by animation and to think that it achieved so much for the time it was created is incredible. The lush details of the city, characters and the events that unfold are all mind blowing. Truly a classic.	2
1101	Falling Down	This has been misinterpreted as endorsing violence, but Schumacher and Smith have, above all, created a thoughtful and believable character study.	2
1102	Boyz n the Hood	I dont belong anywhere near the hood, but we are all people. Boyz n the Hood's take of redemption, triumph, loss, and despair in the most violent shows us that, in the end, it's the person alone who has the strength to create his/her future. 	1
1103	Catwoman	Only way to make it worse would be to make this a musical	0
1104	The Wild Bunch	everyone can fuck off. i highly doubt peckinpah made a better film than pat garrett and billy the kid. 	1
1105	Gayniggers from Outer Space	title delivers!	2
1106	2001: A Space Odyssey	A load of hippy wank with some nice space station effects.	2
1107	Drive	the first 10 minutes..AMAZING....the rest...NOT THAT MUCH	1
1108	Under the Skin	I found this incredibly engaging throughout. A very haunting film. Definitely got under my skin, and then some. I'll be thinking about this film for days. And several scenes will stick with me for a very long time. I find it interesting that the things I loved most about the film are the same things many people hated about it.	0
1109	Knowing	You gotta be kidding me. That's the worst thing i've watched for years. I really need to know how to build a time machine or something that could erase the last hour and a half.	0
1110	Knowing	You gotta be kidding me. That's the worst thing i've watched for years. I really need to know how to build a time machine or something that could erase the last hour and a half.	0
1111	The Room	BUT ALSO 100.	1
1112	Ad Astra	Fucking voiceovers.	1
1113	Gravity	A masterpiece! It's like a visual Fifth of Beethoven or other masterpiece which grabs you and doesn't let go. 	2
1114	The Irishman	gangster picture to end the gangster pictures?	1
1115	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	People are stupid.	0
1116	Iron Man 2	Disappointing in light of the first movie. Feels like it went in the Transformers 2 trap: More effects, more explosions, more fights, more characters, more over-the-top broad comedy and insanely stupid intrigues (the whole Hammer-character is implausible). Plot suffers, tension suffers, credibility suffers BIG-TIME. 	0
1117	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A lot of repeats and some meh twists, for me, but hopefully since this first film covered all that they can now continue the story in a new direction.  It would be great if they had more character development for the new people.  Rei, Fin and Poe are cool but you don't get to know much about them, and all the other characters (ex: the other x-wing pilots) seem like set dressing not people.  Oh well, it was good, just hope they try to improve on what they started.	0
1118	Vampire's Kiss	One of the best performances of all time. Hilarious and unhinged, but also surprisingly subversive.	2
1119	The Hateful Eight	Probably the best marriage of early (read: love letters to 60s-70s cinema) Tarantino and late (read: assembling aforementioned influences to make blunt, crucial sociological statements in a blissfully unaware savant-like fashion) Tarantino that I could have hoped for. 	2
1120	Kill Bill: Volume 1	Tarantino is one sick bastard. And I mean that in the best way possible. 	2
1121	The Blair Witch Project	You either love it or hate it. I thought it was brilliant.	2
1122	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	I honestly couldn't help but like this movie.  I found myself smiling throughout the entire movie and laughing at nearly every quip by the refreshingly original characters.  There was absolutely nothing stale or dry about this movie, and I will definitely add it to my DVD collection.	1
1123	Grave of the Fireflies	Please watch this with somebody else. One of the most touching and powerful pieces of animation I've ever seen.	2
1124	Annihilation	Starts of suprisingly intresting, and ends up with pseudo-science-bullshit (science fiction can be made without something as irritating as dna-reflecting-mutation-bubbles)	0
1125	Body Double	Some movies use dream logic but Body Double uses cocaine logic. Halfway into this film I thought it was garbage, and by the end I thought it might be genius.	0
1126	Day of Wrath	Bleak, beautifully told story about witchcraft, repressed sexuality, and religious zealotry.  The bleak cinematography and understated acting help create a complex, depressing world of cruel punishment and unattainable love.  Wonderful and unexpected.	2
1127	Shaft	A great Blaxploitation movie, the acting is kinda weak, but who cares, everything else is wonderful. The music, the cinematography, the storyline, and everything else you can throw in. And if you don't like it, then shut your mouth!	2
1128	2001: A Space Odyssey	The concept is great.  Despite that, this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen.  There's about twenty minutes of showcasing different spaceships over classical music.  Sounds riveting doesn't it?	2
1129	Apocalypse Now: Final Cut	Godard in an interview with Dick Cavett said the problem with Apocalypse Now is that there was not enough money in the picture. If instead of 50 million, if he had spent 50 billion dollars then it would approach closer to what the American war in Vietnam was about.	1
1130	Apocalypse Now: Final Cut	Godard in an interview with Dick Cavett said the problem with Apocalypse Now is that there was not enough money in the picture. If instead of 50 million, if he had spent 50 billion dollars then it would approach closer to what the American war in Vietnam was about.	1
1131	Magnolia	I don't have a lot of good things to say about this film.  I think it's a complete failure as a drama, as the characters and plot felt very pat (not helped at all by the embarassingly bad dialog).  PT Anderson is a talented visualist, but he shouldn't be allowed to write.	0
1132	The Wackness	Ben Kinglsey shines, the remaining cast members struggle to overcome their characters' uninterestingness and the script.	2
1133	The Hole	"Clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, thump!, thump!, clang!, clang!, clang!, clang!, THUMP!, THUMP! clang!, clang!, clang!, thump!
CLANG!"	1
1134	Foxcatcher	A fantastic psychological thriller about Steve Carrell's prosthetic nose	2
1135	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	The finale is probably the best standoff you'll see. Eastwood could play a game of tiddlywinks in this film and you'd still think he looks amazingly cool and badass.	2
1136	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	One of my all-time favorites, infinitely quotable, and one of the strongest scripts in recent years. Shane Black, where have you been, where are you going?	2
1137	From Justin to Kelly	The single greatest cinematic achievement of our time.	2
1138	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	The plot is as thin as it is negligible, the dialogues are awful, much of the acting sub-standard, the jokes are lame, and the robot fights are not much more than blurs of shapes and colors.	0
1139	The Decalogue	I'm a Kieslowki fan, but I found this dreary, and too unsubtle and heavy-handed for the kind of drama he was doing. If Christians are wondering why church attendance is declining, maybe it's because they treat ethics as a soap opera and treat humans as cartoonish stock characters. The flat and conceptual characters here are a disappointing contrast to the rich characters in his other films. Decalogue is a testament to the misanthropic, dehumanizing arrogance of perceived moral superiority.	0

1141	Nymphomaniac: Volume 1	"Gerçekten çok kötü bir filmdi ya her şeyi ikiye saklamış ya da kötü işte.
It was awful we dont know maybe he hide everything for vol 2 or it was bad "	0
1142	Lolita	The girl in this movie almost turned me into a pedophile.	1
1143	Eyes Wide Shut	If this is all Stanley Kubrick figured aout about love, sex,and desire inhis log years, god save him. Pablum. Boring.	2
1144	Avengers: Endgame	Essentially 3 hours of focus tested fan service, down to the last detail. It's hard to outright dislike, but it's also very difficult to find anything organic or inventive.	0
1145	Room 237	Don't focus on the individual bizarro theories too much. Some are plausible, most are not. For me the motive of this doc is obsession. Listening to the four characters wallow in detail is quite interesting (Moreso than the actual theories).	0
1146	The Big Bird Cage	Great campy fun.	2
1147	10 Cloverfield Lane	10 Cloverfield Lane is a winner for me. Everything is a mystery whether it be the characters or whatever situation they may be in. Your curiosity will nearly consume you. Add to all of this some scattered moments of suspense on top of great performances from the leads. For some, the final act may not do it for you but I happened to enjoy. The ending will leave you with more questions with the biggest mystery being where does the future of this franchise lie? 4 STARS	2
1148	Gravity	Avatar brought 3D to the wide public's attention, but this is the movie that showed everyone what it can really bring to cinema. Absolutely stunning, from every point of view !	2
1149	Blindspotting	One of the better movies of 2018. Apparently this is the director's first feature film and he's previously directed music videos and short films. That stylistic influence definitely shows, and it mostly succeeds. Yet that doesn't take away from the movie's quality of being real. While the writing may get a bit too much sometimes, there are some beautiful scenes, and the overall product is very satisfying.	2
1150	You Were Never Really Here	I love all of Lynne Ramsay's films (rated them top tier), but this was just terrible waste of time. The average ratings are very surprising to me.	1
1151	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Thank goodness. This Star Wars movie doesn't resort to any cheap tricks. A very originally developed story, with a complicated, imperfect, yet well-delivered villain, sensibly story-driven, layered themes, incredible score, and a great cast of supporting characters..... except Forest Whitaker....	2
1152	While She Was Out	WOW...don't mess with Della, does Kim grow old? 	0
1153	Citizen Kane	One of the greatest movies of all time, Orson Welles did a phenomenal job directing, writing, and acting in this picture.  Everybody should have to see this movie some day.	2
1154	Spider-Man: Homecoming	Tom Holland is adorable as the newest incarnation of Spiderman. He's everything you've come to expect from the witty and boyish superhero. This movie, while boasting some impressive action sequences, is notably different from other MCU movies with how low-key it is. While in other MCU movies it's always about saving the world, the galaxy, the universe - this time it's saving a city block. But its none the less entertaining.	2
1155	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	A near-masterpiece right up until the lackluster ending.	0
1156	Office Space	I have never worked in an office setting, but I can totally relate to the main character's wishes of wanting to do absolutely nothing with his days, and that simple fact, combined with Office Space's quirky characters, makes this one of the most iconic cult comedies ever made. This is one of those we all know someone like this movies that everyone should see at some point in their lives. Mike Judge is a genius for things like this and it shows here. Truly a one of a kind film.	2
1157	Kobe Doin' Work	fuck you kobe	1
1158	Her	This is a wry examination of Turing's Test that requires a bit of patience on the part of the viewer.  Scarlett Johansson proves she can act without her body, and Phoenix provides an appropriate combination of curiosity, loneliness, lust, and befuddlement as he deals with a uniquely evolving lover.  The moral issues here are both humorous and surprisingly deep. 	2
1159	For Your Consideration	Woefully unfunny but biting... if this was about an awards season a decade ago.  Tired botox and e-mail jokes are representative of the satirical take here, not that Christopher Guest is ever cutting edge.  Still, his previous works with this core ensemble are seldom this spiteful and compensate with varying degrees of hope and tenderness.  Not here, which amplifies all that is stale.  Jane Lynch, however, is wicked without saying a word.	2
1160	12 Monkeys	Time travel as an identity unravelling headache. Willis is introverted and childlike, rapidly convincing himself of his own psychosis when not wandering around in a giant condom. Gilliam brings a curiously convincing futuristic, discarded brass aesthetic to the preceedings. The best film about time travel ever made.	2
1161	For Your Consideration	Woefully unfunny but biting... if this was about an awards season a decade ago.

1162	Drive	I don't think I'm allowed to give it a lower score than this because of how much I love love love the soundtrack and lighting.	0
1163	Titanic	Pure tripe.  Little historical accuracy.  	0
1164	John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum	Don’t get me wrong - this movie is beautifully shot and edited. I also crave for more old-school action movies like this. But all the creativeness are used up in the film’s awesome first 20-30 minutes. After that the plot turns into nonsense, and seems to destroy the wonderful world building from the first two film. I could also do without Halle Berry. Still entertaining throughout though a bit too long.	2
1165	Gods of Egypt	What amounts to being the cinematic equivalent of taking a sedative, only more torturous, Gods of Egypt is lackluster in practically all respects. If it weren't for the moments of sheer absurdity, unavoidable fits of laughter, along with Geoffrey Rush and Chadwick Boseman's awareness that the film they are in is absolute hot garbage (ham it up to 11 fellas), the audience would be lulled into a painfully forced nap after already suffering with the guilt of spending their dollars on this atrocity.	0
1166	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	I think Phantom Menace might have been better than this shit.	0
1167	Avengers: Age of Ultron	So there was a moment, somewhere in the middle of this film, where Thor jumps into a mystical pool and I had to admit to myself that it had no idea what was going on.  Much if it is fun and it doesn't take itself seriously but, really... What did I just watch?	0
1168	Indie Game: The Movie	Practically a 2 hour ad for Steam.	0
1169	Toy Story 3	One of those films that makes you laugh, cry, smile, and pull all number of facial expressions. And at the end it leaves you feeling both satisfied and happy. Pixar's masterpiece in my eyes.	2
1170	Like Someone in Love	Kiarostami seems to be making a joke out of his own genre, while he creates a short story that could have been penned by the author of Rashomon. The car-driving-in-circles and car-talk scenes, the wise elder giving advice to troubled youth. But the joke is on our expectations of how it will all turn out. Extreme command of pace, plot and setting, as always, and lots of nice incidentals like the parades of schoolkids that flow past the lives of the film's protagonists.	2
1171	Zero Dark Thirty	An important film. Subtly brilliant and perfectly thrilling, Zero Dark Thirty is beautifully paced.The performances are flawless; Jessica Chastain is incredible. Bigelow's vision and attention to detail is admirable and it truly elevates the experience. The film builds to a thrilling ending that ranks among the most intense endings I've ever seen. Powerfully acted, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly written by Mark Boal, Zero Dark Thirty is easily one of the best films of 2012!	2
1172	Transformers	I swear Michael Bay just straps a camera to the back of a coked up dalmatian when he wants to try and film an action sequence.	1
1173	Contact	Many people bag this film. I don't get it, how did you want it to end? With little green men??? I felt they did the best ending they could have. Foster is brilliant and the story moves at a good pace that doesn't rush things. Great screenplay from an extremely complicated book!	2
1174	Baska dilde ask	Saka yapiyor olmalisiniz, neyini ovdunuz bu filmin? Konuda tutarlilik yok, havada kalan onlarca sey var. Neden orada oldugu anlasilmayan sahneler, cikislar, konular... Aman Allah'im. Kabus gibi takila takila ilerliyor. Film neyi anlatiyor? Musteri Hizmetleri calisanlarinin dertlerini mi? Degilse yarim saat niye onu izliyoruz? Her sagir ve dilsiz kisi sinirlendiginde orangutan taklidi mi yapiyor? Hepsinin mi hareketleri bu kadar abartili. Hic sagir dilsiz tanimasam yiyecegim ha!	1
1175	Season of the Witch	So... how many movies does Nicholas Cage have to make before the IRS leaves him alone and he can finally go back to making decent movies instead of this crap... 	0
1176	Entrapment	A boring excuse to show Zeta-Jones's curves.	0
1177	Naked	English drama... well, it's got to be gritty, doesn't it?	2
1178	Fight Club	This story of an insomniac's other personality creates many mind boggling situations that make the viewer question their life.  While the movie is called FIGHT Club and yes does have a fair amount of violence in it, the film was clearly produced to beg a question about life; do we matter?  The character played by Brad Pitt (Tyler Durdan) does a fantastic job of leading this so fight club and later on criminal tasks called project mayhem used to set the real world straight.   	2
1179	A Walk to Remember	There is truly nothing better than to see a romance which is not based on anything but love to come alive on the big screen. Mandy Moore and Shane West did a phenomenal job portraying the parts of Landon and Jamie. You find yourself being heartbroken at the turn of the movie, and forever remembering the quote that really summed up the movie. Love is like the wind. You cannot see it but you can always feel it. Nicholas Sparks did a brilliant job in creating this story.	2
1180	Nymphomaniac: Volume 1	"Trier is always man for a good show, whether you like him or not.  Audience better ready themselves for one hell of a trip around the darkest and brightest corners of human sexuality. It is somehow spellbinding with its many references and provocations which at the same time praise and ridicule art, politics, religion, human intellect, as well as you and me as audience. 
Witty and furtively funny. 
Triers films are definitely always an experience, and this on is too. I think I like it..."	2
1181	I Am Omega	I am legend for watching this shit.	2
1182	The Rocky Horror Picture Show	Great dirty fun, makes me want to put on fishnets and make-up.	2
1183	Eliminators	A challenging piece about what it means to be human.	1
1184	Inglourious Basterds	As awesome as Batman punching Hitler in the face and then planting an American flag into his torso.	2
1185	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Negatives first. Too many Brits. Rey too good at everything. Fight scenes flashy and loud but not exciting. C3PO doesn't sound right. The original cast. The ET-lookalike. Plot is cribbed from ANH. About 20 minutes too long. But despite all that, I had fun watching this movie. It feels right. It's the real thing.	1
1186	The Woman in Black	Harry Potter and the Woman in Black stars Daniel Radcliffe as a frowny-faced Englishman who wanders around an old house examining things. Examining something for longer than four seconds results in a SURPRISE LOUD SOUND. Oh and maybe a ghost, too; but possibly just an angry bird or a noisy faucet. Co-starring: a small dog. 	0
1187	Pink Flamingos	In 2041 there will be someone claiming that 2girls1cup was an outstanding example of tasteless fun. Let's realize that it's an utter nonsense before it's too late.	0
1188	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Too long, bad acting, moronic dialogue, disturbingly fetishistic of the military, incoherent plot, lack of emotional investment in the characters... these are all adjectives that any rational person would expect to describe this movie.  And, honestly, plot and dialogue and acting and basic logic are all nice, but non-essential.  But how in the nine circles of Hell can you make a movie about giant robots fighting and SCREW UP THE FIGHT SCENES?!?!  The mind boggles.	2
1189	2001: A Space Odyssey	Oh god I fell asleep during the spaceship flyby scene and I was even fast forwarding it at the time.	0
1190	12 Years a Slave	This is bad. This is really bad and I'm confused as to why I'm the only one who thinks so. Look, we don't just get to say Man, those slave owners were some sadistic assholes! and stamp racism and slavery as done. Arts job is to articulate complexity - not simplify it. This was The Passion of The Christ - Slavery Edition.	2
1191	Mandy	OK Nic, now b4 Bathroom Scene: Recall 1996: U won an Oscar, were RICH & married to Patrica A ...&.. GO♨️ DAMN: NC sure didn't ☏ this 1 in! Bloody but ≠ vile leering. = More cartoony  ⚠️: not normal film AT ALL: ¼ woozy then ¾ NEON drenched nightmare lunacy. I fell into groove & had blast; as cast seem 2've done. 'Plot' = stock revenge but attacked with total intense loco cinematography, ♬ + acting.  ≅ Lynch+Only God F+Inh Vice+MMax: Unique art-revenge-stoner pic‽❤️?!	2
1192	Mad Max: Fury Road	From its very first scenes, Fury Road vibrates with the energy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game, pushing us forward without the cheap special effects or paper-thin characters that have so often defined the modern blockbuster. Miller hasn't just returned with a new installment in a money-making franchise. The man who re-wrote the rules of the post-apocalyptic action genre has returned to show a generation of filmmakers how they've been stumbling in their attempts to	0
1193	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	The seventh installment of the Star Wars franchise pays tribute to the films that spawned it as well as creating great young characters that the next generation of fans can attach themselves to.	0
1194	Blindspotting	I'm so glad I saw this film.So refreshing and unconventional.It's funny and charismatic while also being intense and electrifying to watch.Not only that it's also wonderfully directed, beautifully shot and the two main performances are really riveting and full of depth.There is some real passion behind this movie and it shows.It deals with themes that are really important for today's society and I think for that reason it should be seen by a lot of people. 	2
1195	The Rules of Attraction	This shows honestly - and accurately - the destructive behavior of a handful of college students.  To the film's credit, it does not take a moral stance by shunning the actions of it characters.  Ironically, that may be why so many critics hate it.	0
1196	The Ballad of Buster Scruggs	It had its moments was not the Coen's best showing. Honestly the really outdated portrayal of Native Americans did not help things. 	0
1197	Mad Max: Fury Road	Theron and Hardy kill it in a wonderfully good way. Women central to the story. What a lovely day!	2
1198	The Hateful Eight	Tarantino is a lot of things, but politically correct isn't one of them. Safe doesn't interest him. He brings the war home, baby, with all the political, geographical, social, sexual and racial implications we're still wrangling with today. Watch out for Tarantino's seething subtext in The Hateful Eight -- it'll nag at your conscience and no way will it let go.	2
1199	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Johnny Depp makes this movie extremely fun.	2
1200	Tunnel Rats	my war epic, one off my favurites of all off my films amd of all time, mind you. in these film i pay homarge to everythink from stephen spielberg to stanley cuberick, full metal jacket and the like.. i also pay homage to alfrefred hitchock in this film of mine.	2
1201	Inception	Mistakes - 1) The kick of the van going off the bridge should have woken up Arthur in the hotel dream level since he was awake in that level and in the level above he was falling. 2)  In the first layer of the dream, you have the car flipping repeatedly. In the second layer, the whole world is also spinning. But in the third layer, they are not spinning, even though they would also be spinning in the second layer. The effects from the first layer carry on to the second layer, but not the third.	0
1202	Cop Out	fuck you	1
1203	Pacific Rim	technically it was a success for Del Toro. the problem is with the aliens, the movie doesn't give much information about them and another problem is with the depth of catastrophe, emotionally I couldn't share feelings with the people of the earth because it doesn't seem real to me.	1
1204	The Woman in Black	90 minutes of Daniel Radcliffe opening drawers with loud cranky birds in them	1
1205	City of God	Excellent and very serious. If you don't like serious, avoid this film, because it's serious. And excellent.	2
1206	AVP: Alien vs. Predator	How to kill two legendary franchises in one movie.	1
1207	Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows	What a pity that such a complicated and complex character is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. and in the hands of the mixed up Guy Richie.It could and should have been an intelligent, wit and promising theme for a movie..The humour is forced  and lame, there is a plot but it is not represented in the rank of  Sherlock Holmes class..it's all mixed up and I don't like the result. The detective part of the story is lost and shallow and is replaced by running around and  action.WOULDN'T WATCH It twice	0
1208	Hitman	they tried to mix  the personality of the bourne identity with the russian theme and babes of XXX and the style from james bond... it didn't work. Also Olyphant shows to much emotions to be a cool assassin and Dougray Scott's interpol cop tries to use cynicism to look like a hard cop but also he fails to do that.	1
1209	Spectre	Flat, boring (!), way too long, a wasted Monica Belucci, an even more wasted Christoph Waltz...sigh. What happened, Sam Mendes??	0
1210	Spectre	Flat, boring (!), way too long, a wasted Monica Belucci, an even more wasted Christoph Waltz...sigh. What happened, Sam Mendes??	0
1211	The Avengers	This film convinced me that I'm done with superhero movies. I was bored to tears by the campy acting and childish, lowest common denominator humour. Meanwhile the action, which is supposed to hold it all together, was a boring mess of CGI and loud metallic bangs.	0
1212	Casablanca	It truly is the pinnacle of the Hollywood studio system...	2
1213	Ocean's Thirteen	Hopefully we won't see Ocean's Fourteen.  Though this movie wasn't bad, its time to end this series.	2
1214	The Thin Man	There is nothing like this being made in current Hollywood. Powell and Loy are so great together that is just wonderful to watch them play off each other.	2
1215	Avatar	Two great things: absolutely wonderful visual design with great execution and taking sides with the natives for once. Without these, it is just a silly cliche of an adeventure movie, very funny to watch and targetting teenagers and such. But more of it, this movie has a very pessimistic message: No matter how much developed they are, human beings will always be stupid, brutal, greedy bastards.	0
1216	Falling Down	The naysayers claim we are to identify with Douglas's character, but i disagree.  This is a train wreck of a human being, whereas say Taxi Driver was a redeemable person that was just a bit touched.  And it reflected a time when actual disgruntled postal employees were shooting up their offices, simply because they had lost all reasonable faculty.  No this is a great movie, I'll not have anyone say otherwise.	2
1217	The Lego Movie	Far more fun than it had any right to be!	2
1218	The African Queen	Two people as different as differnt can be; ride the African Queen down the river and out of the jungle while battling the boat, the elements, the Germans, and their disperate views of life.  A great adventure.	2
1219	Kiki's Delivery Service	The best magic here is in the bravery of a young child, augmented by the social structure that supports her. There is nothing so fleeting and transient as ethical exchange, this is less a romantic film than a romance about community. It doesn't have any wrong ideas and even a few mean ones about growing up. 	2
1220	Inglourious Basterds	Tarantino does history. Well, that's new. While chapters 1 and 3 give this movie some depth (at times almost disguising it as a proper WWII film), sections 2, 4 and 5 serve us the ultimate Tarantino experience. What's more to say to this Pulp Fiction of the '40s: Brad Pitt is great as a Tennessee dead-butch and casting Christoph Waltz = Bingo! 	2
1221	Audition	"Arguably the most tense film I have ever seen. It flips SO HARD from the first hour to the second that it was like being in a car accident...in a great way. The tension that Takashi builds until we see the true nature of the villain is some of the best stuff I have ever seen. the scene when they first call her is fantastic. there wasn't much about this film that I didn't love.
 "	2
1222	Zulu	The quintessential British action film of the 60s, also notable for being Michael Caine's film debut. John Barry's awesome score gives an almost otherworldly quality to this excellent, based on fact battle film. First rate acting from all involved, particularly Nigel Green as (historically fictional) Color Sargeant Bourne & James Booth as (historically real) Private Hook. Lush scenery, brilliant color, & narration by Richard Burton. Ripping.	2
1223	Inception	The style is the film's strong point, as the characters aren't too fleshed out nor is the plot that exciting. Not that it matters much, as the astonishing effects work, cinematography, soundtrack, sound design and set pieces make Inception an unforgettable experience.	2
1224	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	I saw this part 6 hours after watching the previous one for the first time, so I still remember what happened before. This movie focuses on the WAR  for a change and has its surprises which is a good thing, but it has its downsides, too. There were too many repetitions, there were also moments that felt like a pure fanservice (depressed Luke joking? Really?). The cool idea of the Abyss was never extended. This part is definitely better than the previous one, but it has many unused opportunities.	0
1225	Wild at Heart	Along with Dune it's one of Lynch's worst efforts, but the worst Lynch is still good film by general standard. Unusual in telling its story of love and the wild human beings who bristle with life, Wild at Heart is much like The Elephant Man in that a typical story is taken and given Lynchian elements. Despite its pedigree, the film is edited somewhat poorly and moves at a janky pace. There's little to engage the viewer beyond visceral images and it lacks the depth of Lynch's other films.	0
1226	The Incredibles	What's better than a movie about a family full of superheros? The incredibles is an excellent movie for the whole family, even the little ones.  The humor is clever and the action is non-stop.  With a combination of all different kinds of movies, The Incredibles sets itself up as one of the best animation movies of all time.  Ironically, its a movie for all ages willing to have a fun time at the theatre.  Incredible is an understatement. 	2
1227	Sweet Smell of Success	I haven't watched a film with dialogue as well written as this since, shit, probably a Tennessee Williams film, or something. The noir look (something that doesn't quite automatically hook me) worked well here, New York City is as claustrophobic in this film as you'll ever see it. Burt Lancaster's heel turn is the real star here, Curtis' mannerisms are a bit unintentionally funny these days, but that doesn't detract from how goddamn great this is.	2
1228	The Crazies	  Good: made you really root for the characters, pacing was well done, really kept you on the edge of your seat, great job building tension ; - Bad: predictable at times, didn't do enough to tell the backstory/details, didn't bring a whole lot new to the genre, military a bit too one-dimensional	1
1229	The Last Man on Earth	It falls apart in the 3rd act when things start feeling rushed and actions happen with little explanation. The rest of the movie's enjoyable, though, and is definitely worth it if you're a fan of Vincent Price or the genre.	0
1230	The Last Man on Earth	It falls apart in the 3rd act when things start feeling rushed and actions happen with little explanation. The rest of the movie's enjoyable, though, and is definitely worth it if you're a fan of Vincent Price or the genre.	0
1231	Drive	After we got out of the theater, my girlfriend and I stood there trying to think of something this movie did well. Sadly, Bryan Cranston and the cinematography were all that we could think of. 	0
1232	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	Literally the worst narrative I've seen in recent years. Though the special effects are impressive, its really difficult to tell what the hell is going on when the robots are fighting eachother. Alot worse than the first one.	0
1233	Finding Nemo	In this hilarious animated Disney-Pixar film, an adorable dad clownfish named Marlin goes on an incredible journey through the deep depths of the ocean searching for his lost son. Along the way he encounters an absent-minded blue tang fish named Dory and Australian sea turtles surfing the East Australian Current (EAC). Though this journey is depressing at times for Marlin, Dory and Crush, the sea turtle, add comic relief that help this movie surf to the top of the charts.	2
1234	Death at a Funeral	This horrible excuse for a remake is quite possibly the worst remake I've ever seen.  I'd rather watch the Keanu Reeves remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still a hundred times in a row than watch these inept actors struggle to replicate the exceptional performance of the original cast.  Chris Rock, Luke Wilson, shame on you.   Even the little person who was in the original didn't perform as well as he did the first time.  You'd think that he would be better, having done it before.  AVOID THIS.	1
1235	What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?	Though Bette Davis gives one of the best performances I've seen in quite some time, the movie seems to lack any form of logic, with characters making the stupidest and most illogical decisions, and the movie drags on far too long.  Still, the tension was high throughout almost the entire work, and Baby Jane should be remembered alongside the top villains of her time. 	0
1236	Loving Vincent	take away the animation and you have a pretty boring movie. 	0
1237	Titanic	Just because you're basing something on a real life tragedy, the artisitc liberties don't just open up for you to use every epic and romantic cliche in fabricating it.	2
1238	Rio Bravo	The film was made as a response to High Noon, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way.	2
1239	Incubus	This movie is unbelievable. It wasn't unique enough to shoot it in Esperanto - it apparently had to be one of the weirdest Demon films out there. Bergman by way of the Outer Limits.	2
1240	Titanic	Just because you're basing something on a real life tragedy, the artisitc liberties don't just open up for you to use every epic and romantic cliche in fabricating it.	2
1241	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Scenes from this movie have really bothered me. Jack Nicholson seems to me like a bully who is being presented as a hero. I believe I've seen most of this movie in parts at different times in my life, and can't imagine sitting through the whole thing it was so ugly. 	0
1242	Man on Wire	After all the hype, this left me a little cold. While I enjoyed the tale with all its Gallic flare, I wasn't that moved by the bigger philosophical messages it strained to impart. 	2
1243	The Haunting	"Is this a haunted house film or a psychological thriller?  The beauty is that this film lets you decide.  The true horror of The Haunting all takes place in your own mind. The setup for this movie is simple; A college professor studying the paranormal enlists three people to stay with him in a reputedly haunted house to study the phenomena.  Before all is said and done, at least one member of this party will not leave.
"	2
1244	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	the one that started it all! the actors are terrible and the story and characters are even worse. it was so damn boring and long. i'm really not into these types of movies AT ALL! sorry Lord of the Rings fans. i don't care how original these movies might be.	0
1245	Mandy	Crazy. Good. Nicolas Cage is channeling Rudolph Klein-Rogge, Paul Muni and Conrad Veidt. Nicolas Cage is a singular talent who can go from crazy to pathos in seconds. A hypnotic performance in a visceral spectacle. 	1
1246	The Matrix	The Matrix will blow your mind. This film is one of the first masterpieces to use more than 30 cameras to take one continuous scene. The acting might not be that great but the idea is very original and multi-faced. This is a must see film that will be an example for generations of films to come.	2
1247	Network	This wasn't a satire, this was a prophecy.	1
1248	Marketa Lazarová	I've read over the years how this is the 'best Czech movie ever made' and was excited to see it after getting a region-free player. However, I have to say I was disappointed. Perhaps the story is a familiar one to Czechs, but I couldn't figure out what was going on here or who was who. The cinematography and music were very nice, but after an hour I got so frustrated I turned it off, which is a rarity for me. Maybe I'll give this another chance in the future.	0
1249	The Revenant	1385: one of those films that you wish it would never ends!	0
1250	Us	It's a shame that Jordan Peele's first film, which was so deeply ground in symbolism and subtlety, will effect his career so much. This one shows signs of the same winking subtlety that the director is known for, but at the end of the day, it's just a well-made horror film. The score is chilling. The cast is stellar from the top down. Peele knows how to subvert expectations, just when you think you've got him figured out. Us is a must-see for horror fans and fans of cinema alike.	2
1251	Inception	One of the best movies I've ever seen	2
1252	Spectre	Spectre is a well made, very exciting thrill ride. It's gripping, it's funny and it's well written. Despite its unimaginative direction, this probably stands as one of the better Bond films.	2
1253	Ex Machina	Dance sequence! 	1
1254	Jurassic World	"Completly lacks the charm of the first movie. 
The writers of the movie pretty much sums it up in their own dialogue within the movie. Why make a super monster, dinosaurs should be enough. 
Sadly just another of a long line of revived franchises that is only out there to make money, not add something new to the universe"	0
1255	Her	Here we are in the future, surrounded by beautiful technology and little human connection. This is a story about the uneasy and weird relationship between our biological needs and the creations we built to attend to them. We are ultimately forced to confront the fact that flesh is flesh and code is code.	1
1256	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Seeing Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens in 3D Imax was the best film-going experience I have ever had. This is coming from someone who is not taken away by the franchise. The landscapes were gigantic and captivating. I was so carried away that when someone in the theater would get up, I initially would think they were fake and the movie was real. I love the new lead characters. I could go on for a while about how this is a visual masterpiece.  I wanted to pause the film and stare at th	0
1257	Taxi Driver	A beautiful cinematic representation of the complete mental deconstruction of one human being in a world where the filth is piled neck high every direction you look.  DeNiro never fails to fall perfectly in step with each character he portrays, and Bickle is no exception.  I found myself feeling the disgust and hatred he felt as each scene went buy.  One of Scorsese's finest.	2
1258	Touch of Evil	The opening scene! The variety of angles throughout the movie is amazing. Welles wrote such an amazing character for himself. A cop who has created such a worldview that he's unable to understand his evilness: whatever the evidence (or lack thereof) they're guilty!. I think it's as relevant as ever for people in positions of power. Unfortunately, in the real world, they more than often win.	0
1259	The Tingler	I loved this movie, being a fan of Vincent Price and all his movies. Like the summary says, he discovers this centipede/lobster like creature that lives in all of us and causes the death of those severely frightened. He experiments on it a lot which leads to the first ever LSD trip ever portrayed on film. William Castle loved to freak people out so whenever the tingler came on screen, audience members would feel their chairs vibrate. Quirky, fun, and it does not take itself too seriously.	2
1260	How to Train Your Dragon	This is one of the few 3D movies where the use of this technology makes sense, so far. It enhances the action elements, notably scenes of explosions and Hiccup riding his dragon, which seemingly is the major draw of 3D. Furthermore, it has a nice plot consisting of a mix between a coming of age and buddy picture. It spoke to my inner child, and certainly if I still was an 8 year old, I would be riding the family dog whilst concocting a scheme to build it wings and make it shoot fire.	2
1261	Get Out	Catherine Keener returns in Being John Malkovich 2	2
1262	Nymphomaniac: Volume 1	retarded.	1
1263	(500) Days of Summer	The more original this piece is, the more truth you can find in there. A lot of men would say Yep, I feel like him and Yep, she is that b***h I have met too. Actualy this film does not claim to be a romantic comedy and it is not. It is a film about love - how do we feel it, how do we measure it, and how much wee need it.	0
1264	Venom	Not a masterpiece but it has nice cgi and good acting by Tom. 	2
1265	Broken Flowers	An utter wash, from beginning to end. An utterly joyless experience, with some more thankless acting by Bill Murray. Jarmusch takes us around in circles, giving us nothing until a lame ending that is supposed to put it all in perspective. Whatever.	0
1266	The Girl Next Door	Amazing story... poorly made.	2
1267	The Revenant	So Leonardo DiCaprio gets mauled by a bear, burns his own neck, and sleeps inside a horse butt-naked. That's all you need to know.	0
1268	Serenity	Excellent Sci-Fi spin-off from the ill fated TV show Firefly. Great if you are not a fan of the show, even better if you are, this is one of the finest Sci-Fi flicks of 2005	2
1269	Baby Driver	Good movie. The first 20 minutes we're masterful, and I can't help but feel things got progressively lazy after the coffee dance. 	2
1270	Her	First time I cried in a movie in a long time	1
1271	Good Night, and Good Luck	I really liked this movie. This story hasnt really been told well before and I thought they did a damned good job of it. 	2
1272	Amadeus	Beautiful movie about a troubled passionate artist	2
1273	The Irishman	I prefer films with narrative purpose. A story goal. That means having an inequity that somebody is attempting to rectify, and The Irishman doesn't have that. It's a collection of things that just...happen for 3.5 hours. Yes, there is good performances, yes the visuals, cinematography, editing, and use of dialogue is masterful. But without something our characters are trying to DO from the get go...to me, there's just no point.	2
1274	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	"all of the action none of world building ,unearned outlandish setpieces shoddily taped together with nostalgia, the  desperation from fans is the only thing keeping this afloat, 
take an expansive universe reduce it nothing and you have this film truly a film where profit is the primary motivation"	0

1279	The Grand Budapest Hotel	I've never liked Wes Anderson until now - for whatever reason, I completely adored this. Maybe this changes everything!	0
1280	All the President's Men	I have a wife and a family and a dog and a cat. :p	1
1281	The Ghost Writer	A candid old-fashioned political thriller with just the right amount of sarcastic humor. Beautifully directed with phenomenal score and great performances. Loved Kim Catrall. Free Polanski immediately !!!	2
1282	Altered States	The unconscious protruding into the reality in the form of a momentary high speed mutation. Cronenberg and Lynch are not far, but the film commits a mortal sin at one point putting on screen, in all its fakeness, nothing less that a character from the Planet of Apes. The change is so abrupt that if you were watching it on tv, you would think someone accidentally sat on the remote control. It then repents and becomes great again offering the incredibly surreal scene in the tank room. 	0
1283	12 Angry Men	That's how dialogs make the movies great.	2
1284	Her	A film in which the manic pixie dream girl becomes the mechanical pixie dream girl and develops into an entity so distinct from the man determined to own her that she highlights the blurred line between simulated and real feelings. The music and stylization of the film work in perfect harmony. The film presents not a technophile's dystopia, but a world in which humans have developed emotions independently and in conjunction with other human contact; they act the same in any realm. It's all us.	1
1285	Vanilla Sky	An ambitious mix of genres, Vanilla Sky collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise's performance lacks depth, and it's hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.	0
1286	Aya Seyahat	Çekimler, sesler, fon müziğinin olmayışı, mizahi ve güzel bir fikri berbat etmiş. Çok donuk, çat diye kapanan diyaloglar, bir an sunum izliyormuş hissi yaratmakta. Ayrıca bunda bile türbanlılar mağdur olmuş amk. 	1
1287	Manhattan Murder Mystery	Very fun mix of comedy and mystery, a la Agatha Christie. Also, we can enjoy the great chemistry among Allen and Keaton.	2
1288	Flesh for Frankenstein	A delightfully bad movie. Seemingly intentionally campy, it is fraught with bad acting and shock scenes designed for it's original 3d release. However, it is sumptuous in scenic detail and should be watched for that reason. Also, take note of the lab and it's similarity to the Rocky Horror Picture Show lab. All in all, a classic, cult movie.	1
1289	A Clockwork Orange	Boring. And I found it impossible to sympathize with Alex, whose motivation for violence is completely unexplained.	0
1290	Repo! The Genetic Opera	Any film where Paris Hilton's face falls off is a worthy watch	0
1291	Forrest Gump	The story of Forrest Gump is an American Classic. Tom Hanks does an amazing job playing a simple-minded man who makes his way through important events in American history, like the Vietnam War and the Kennedy Assassination. I recommend this movie because it not only appeals to the adults that were alive and remember the events in Forrest's life, but it also appeals to the younger generation in providing an alternative way to learn history. 	2
1292	Hard Candy	Here we have a character so unlikable that she inspires sympathy for a paedophile simply because he, too, is being forced to hear her speak.	0
1293	A Clockwork Orange	Boring. And I found it impossible to sympathize with Alex, whose motivation for violence is completely unexplained.	0
1294	The Breakfast Club	I cannot think of a movie with worse values. Everyone is creeped out by Ally Sheedy, but then she puts on make up and the jock falls in love with her. They make the nerd write all of their essays for them, and for some reason he seems to be happy to do it. I was ready to give this movie an 8/10 up until the last ten minutes, but John Hughes then ruined every character in the movie and told his audience to be superficial assholes.	0
1295	Suspiria	While I do like that a risk was taken here to make something different from the original film I can't say that this direction was the right one to take at all. This is a very slow paced, overlong and messy film. I enjoy some of the acting, the visuals and Thom Yorke's soundtrack (which seems to work FAR better without the context of this film) but I can't say much else left an impression on me. The more unsettling moments didn't have much of an impact on me. A missed opportunity for sure. 	0
1296	The Addams Family	Words cannot describe the comedic and cinematic design genius that made this movie a permanent favorite of mine.	2
1297	Shame	Fassbender's performance is good but McQueen's artlessly calculated directing and a script which never fully explores or develops on the themes presented prevent this from being any better than average. Predictable, overrated and too reliant on a style which is not as clever or well executed as McQueen seems to think it is.	0
1298	Les Misérables	If you've seen the play, you won't see that much new here. The music is compelling, and it's got a great story. Hugh Jackman is pretty good as Jean Valjean and brings a lot of enthusiasm to the role, which mostly works but occasionally doesn't. Russell Crowe, however, is a total dud as Javert and sounds like he's got a cold through his songs. He was seriously miscast in this role. Not to mention that little cartoon thud at the end.	0
1299	Enchanted	Thank you, Disney, for having the balls to make fun of yourself like this. Of course, it's pretty trendy to be cynical these days, but it was still a heck of a lot of fun. The first 10 minutes really make me miss 2D animation.	2
1300	Annihilation	Does anyone in her class or watching the movie need the cell division exposition? Why didn't they start by sending someone in just a few meters? Why does everyone accept the 'death by something/each-other' false dilemma? Why is the only person to have come out alive accompanied by one snoozing doctor? Why is only one of the team doing any research? These are just a few of the nagging questions that made this movie feel really stupid. Entertaining though! Like a daft old Star Trek episode.	0
1301	Slither	A hilariously gory horror comedy that is an amalgamation of 80's body horror films, tounge-in-cheek humor, a cast that kills in every scene, and a Night of the Living Dead-esque setting sets this movie apart from most modern horror fare as an inventive and original sci-fi/horror/comedy film that is sure to delight any fans of the above genres listed.	2
1302	Dagon	Surprisingly good, one of the few lovecraft films who try to capture the essence his works and succeeds.	2
1303	The Breakfast Club	I cannot think of a movie with worse values. Everyone is creeped out by Ally Sheedy, but then she puts on make up and the jock falls in love with her. They make the nerd write all of their essays for them, and for some reason he seems to be happy to do it. I was ready to give this movie an 8/10 up until the last ten minutes, but John Hughes then ruined every character in the movie and told his audience to be superficial assholes.	0
1304	Suspiria	While I do like that a risk was taken here to make something different from the original film I can't say that this direction was the right one to take at all. This is a very slow paced, overlong and messy film. I enjoy some of the acting, the visuals and Thom Yorke's soundtrack (which seems to work FAR better without the context of this film) but I can't say much else left an impression on me. The more unsettling moments didn't have much of an impact on me. A missed opportunity for sure. 	0
1305	Prometheus	Ridley Scott's expedition into Alien-mythology and life's existential questions was bound to be a tricky maneuvering act, but no one could've foreseen a detour of this magnitude. It avoids everythings it wants to explore, and the story screams for characters that care and wants to be cared about.	0
1306	Magnolia	It's long, it's rough, and it's beautiful. This one doesn't just entertain, it heals. Find three hours to watch it some time.	2
1307	The Lion King	This animated Disney classic, portrays the story of Shakespeare's Hamlet in a new, kid-friendly drama, with African lions as the main characters. Simba, the main cub, learns the harsh lessons of life at a young age and attempts to escape this cruel past in a forgotten paradise. Nola, the heroine cub, forces SImba to finally face his history and to fight for everything that is good in the land. 	2
1308	Saving Private Ryan	Saving Private Ryan has one of the most legendary and unforgettable opening scenes in film. The plot is very interesting, whether it be the battle scenes or the less intense talking scenes. The cast of actors including Tom Hanks and Matt Damon make a very compelling and riveting film.	2
1309	The Notebook	Adapted from Nicholas Spark's novel, this is oneof the best love stories depicted over the last decade. Gosling and McAdams chemistry can be felt by the audience, in a romantic drama that has the potential to emotionally sweep the viewers off their feet. Old fashioned values are portrayed which makes Noah's (Gosling)  pursuit of Allie (McAdams) a tear jerker for all.  	2
1310	The Lion King	This animated Disney classic, portrays the story of Shakespeare's Hamlet in a new, kid-friendly drama, with African lions as the main characters. Simba, the main cub, learns the harsh lessons of life at a young age and attempts to escape this cruel past in a forgotten paradise. Nola, the heroine cub, forces SImba to finally face his history and to fight for everything that is good in the land. 	2
1311	8½	Inventive meditation on the creative process and on the male mind.	2
1312	Toy Story	An instant classic in which Disney did an outstanding job on. It was one of the first animated movies and set the bar for the rest of animated movies. Buzz and Woody join up and make one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie will have you laughing throughout the duration of the movie. 	2
1313	Up	Pixar hits another home-run with their new light-hearted, heartfelt comedy. A story about making your dreams come true, Up has plenty to offer to both adults and children alike. The script is one of Pixar's best and stuck somewhere between laughs are themes that stay with the audience long after leaving the theater.	2
1314	Kingdom of Heaven	The Director's Cut really is a completely different film, vastly superior to the original. Regardless of your thoughts of the threatrical release, you owe it to yourself to watch the DC.	2
1315	Bad News Bears	Isn't it sad when a movie made several decades ago was more brave, funny, and realistic about kids?	2
1316	Remember the Titans	A team oriented movie that leaves you inspired to overcome the greatest obstacles you might face.  This football movie shows the struggle to overcome racial prejudiced.  The boys must come together to achieve one common goal, winning states.  Sports fanatics will love it, and those who aren't will have a greater respect for team sports.  	2
1317	A Quiet Place	A film that takes its title literally. Excellent acting, monster design, general attention to detail. Extremely tense film that doesn't rely entirely on jump scares for the horror. A little bit of suspension of disbelief needed at times, but overall a great film.	2
1318	BlacKkKlansman	C - Amazing. A big part of me thinks this should be shown in schools. Great story, played really well. Does a superb job of showing how racists dance around their racism. Really interesting how Adam Driver's character has to think about things that previously were, and should be, irrelevant to him.  The stinger at the end with modern footage is stunningly effective. It's worth mentioning here that the film is hilariously funny at times. 	2
1319	Bird Box	Why bother writing a review for something this mediocre	0
1320	Hereditary	Starts off well, with an intriguing premise, before completely losing the plot and going off the deep end. It piles up the weird stuff to such a ridiculous level that it's just not effective as a horror movie. There is some good stuff here, and it's well acted, but sometimes less is more.	1
1321	L'uomo meccanico	Wow.  An off-kilter pulp science-fiction sort of thing with a giant remote controlled robot going on a criminal rampage, living it up at a society party, fighting another giant robot that gets less than a minute of screen time, etc.  The one fragmentary cut still in existence appears to have excised the Feuillade-styled setup and plotting in favor of just keeping the robot's big scenes, plus a couple moments of the star and creator of this madness hopping around like a loon.	1
1322	Toy Story	The standard for all other animated movies. 	1
1323	American Beauty	"This is not just another 'silly crap of Hollywood'. It's certainly an exception. Watch it without any prejudice and you'll see what I mean. 
   I really understand why Ingmar Bergman liked this film  and why he was so misunderstood ... "	2
1324	The Passion of the Christ	Even if you're not a religious person the story of Christ here in Mel Gibson's view is harrowing and brutal. It's tough to watch, but very very well done. Mel Gibson does put a bit of a twist on some aspects of the story, but it's just his speculation of events not described within the context of the bible.	2
1325	Sin City	Some groundbreaking stuff around. Social grotesque and a comic book bound together on a LITERAL big screen take.	0
1326	Black Panther	Delivers on its promises with incredible enthusiasm and heart. As a screen presence, Jordan trounces Boseman, which adds to the superb moral complexity of this afrofuturist popcorn-munching adventure.	2
1327	Coraline	People are right when they say Coraline doesn't have a deep plot going for it. But it doesn't need one either. The excellent visuals and music, along with an atmospheric fairy-tale world inhabited by intriguing and imaginative characters were more than enough to pull me in, and not let go until the closing credits roll.	2
1328	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	This movie is crazy. It has it's own high energy language of storytelling that is a little off-putting at first. But once you get used to it, it's just awesome and hysterical. The cast are all awesome with special points to Kieran Culkin and Ellen Wong. And Edgar Wright does an incredible balancing act of charm, coolness, romance, comedy, action and just sheer insanity. It's such a fun movie to watch and it's also way deeper and more meaningful than it has any right to be. Well done, sir.	2
1329	Mad Max: Fury Road	The level of detail combined with the level prolonged intense non-cgi action is a new benchmark. The design quality from the vehicles to pendants is a feast. So good I'm genuinely not sure how any action flick is topping this in the near future. Film was storyboarded first, a rareity, but should be the blueprint for all action flicks, the kinetic aspect was perfect.	2
1330	Fight Club	Absolute masterpiece.  This is simply the greatest movie I have ever seen.  It is so well made and has very much depth to it.  It is very deep and may take a while to grow on you, but once it does it's truly an amazing movie experience.  The twist near the end will blow your mind.  Be prepared for something big when watching this.  It gets better and better everytime, you will always catch something new.  Too amazing for words	2
1331	Mad Max: Fury Road	The level of detail combined with the level prolonged intense non-cgi action is a new benchmark. The design quality from the vehicles to pendants is a feast. So good I'm genuinely not sure how any action flick is topping this in the near future. Film was storyboarded first, a rareity, but should be the blueprint for all action flicks, the kinetic aspect was perfect.	2
1332	Escape from New York	Most of the movies that I have seen of Carpenter's have brilliant concepts. The start of most of these movies are very promising and nicely taken, but somehow he always seems to lose the act in-between and a tame ending follows.	1
1333	Man on Fire	"Dakota Fanning is perfection in kid form. This movie is where I really grew to love her, and I believe she has a long and prosperous career ahead of her.

Mr. Washington was great too.:-D"	2
1334	Pan's Labyrinth	A very dark film encompassing everything that a young girl in the midst of war and mentally unstable military men can perceive.  Despite my lack of interest in such things, I won't deny that the film did a fantastic job of what it intended.  Pushing me to the edge of my seat and pulling my heart strings.	2
1335	Piranha	i dont care what anyone says, this movie is exactly what it wants to be and pulls it off perfectly. If you watched it and didnt like it then why did you watch it in the first place? what were you expecting? personally id expect a movie about mutant fish to be a comedy and if it wasnt id expect it to be terrible. Mr. Aja wanted to make a gory comedy with loads of nudity in it so he through mutant fish into spring break, the perfect recipy and then through in some delishis one liners and your gold	0
1336	Night of the Demon	One of the great horror films.  Even the much debated final glimpse of the demon has a terrifying potency.  Well acted, beautifully directed and loaded with great images.	2
1337	Noah	While it looked pretty, it was just a bore. I don't think God destroyed the world in the Abrahamic tradition because we cut down trees and shit. And Noah turns into a pretentious teenager who thinks he's hot shit because he thinks humanity is full of scum man yeah man just let us all wipe out and leave the earth to the animals man humans ain't done nothing to improve the planet Give me a fucking break you misanthropic cunt	0
1338	Mad Max: Fury Road	This is a wake-up call to action films of the 21st century.	1
1339	Waking Life	Pointless, jejune and pretentious (but hey, it's animated!) If you know any academic philosophers and you'd like to subject them to slow, painful torture, this would be the way to go.	0
1340	Waking Life	Pointless, jejune and pretentious (but hey, it's animated!) If you know any academic philosophers and you'd like to subject them to slow, painful torture, this would be the way to go.	0
1341	Suicide Squad	My ten year old kids loved it.  I'm betting they won't love it if they watch it again in 10 years	2
1342	Chelsea Peretti: One of the Greats	It was fine. They kind of overused the cutaways, and there wasn't really a memorable joke, or one that we'll all immediately think of when we hear this name. Also, her final joke was one of the weakest of the set, which is never a good way to end a stand up show, obviously. 	0
1343	Toy Story	The Toy Story movies are all guilt trips for me, I completely adored both when I was younger and it's still a favorite. It's always a hard decision picking one over the other, but I have to say that the second one's better, but this is an animated film classic itself.	2
1344	Seven Samurai	Quintessential Kurosawa.  This movie belongs in any film lover's collection.  Mifune shines, as usual.	2
1345	The Village	This director's films revolve around their twists and here, it actually turns out to be what you first expect and dismiss for being too obvious. Disappointing but with moments of brilliant tension.	2
1346	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	This is my favourite Anderson film though it's hard to pin down why. The cast are excellent, it's consistently funny and it has heart. But I think the visual style might be what makes it work for me. The world presented is one of magic and wonder, full of fantastical sea life and vibrant colour . This uninhibited style contrasts with the repression and sadness of the characters wonderfully and coupled with the brilliant music gives the emotional scenes a beautiful bittersweet quality.	2
1347	John Carter	One of the best told sci-fi/fantasy stories I have seen in a while. The plot is a bit predictable but always entertaining, the characters are introduced in a proper way and the story covers enough ground to really get a feel for the planet and its inhabitants.	2
1348	Howl's Moving Castle	Not one of Miyazaki's best, but I'd rather see not one of Miyazaki's best than a lot of other films.	2
1349	Toy Story 4	Funny and touching. Even the villains became relatable. So much better than expected and everything I would want from beginning to end. 	2
1350	Splice	this is awful. from the beginning to the end, this movie is very, very confused. it aims to be a dark science fiction thriller intertwined with inter-species sexuality and horror elements but then what could very well be the plot of a bad romantic comedy comes into play along with a selection of questionable plot choices and you're left with adrien brody trying to rationalize raping a bird-reptile-fish-bug-human mix. splice makes little sense, has little purpose and leaves a very bad aftertaste.	0
1351	High Plains Drifter	Painting the town red never gets old.	1
1352	The Muppet Movie	If you do not like this movie, you are a bad person. It is one of the crowning achievements of human civilization.	2
1353	Melancholia	WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS FUCKING MOVIE.. pretentious shit	0
1354	Enchanted	Although I'm trying really hard not to, I actually like this movie. Amy Adams does a great job as the lost disney-princess; she really captures the laughable euphoria that is often seen in Disney-princesses' behaviour, but never really satirized proper. Until now, that is.	2
1355	Persona	Swathed by some of the most perfect images ever captured on film, you will revel in that which Bergman has created: namely, the cinematic equivalent of a woman who has dug a hole in her soul only to be buried by the weight of her own guilt.  	1
1356	World Trade Center	3 guys stuck in a hole can only keep me entertained for so long.  When Nicholas Cage is one of the guys the attention span is reduced tenfold.	0
1357	King Kong	A meaningless film, but a good one. Want to see the film-making in whole? Watch Kong. Martial arts, car rides, ships, copters, romance, retro, CGI, animals, jokes...it's all in there, you name it.	2
1358	Man of Steel	This movie starts off well and has many good parts; however, if this movie is anything it is proof that Zack Synder is not a good director. 	0
1359	Spirited Away	Totally deserving of its oscar. This film has a really simple, yet moving plotline that sucks the viewer in from the beginning. Even if you aren't a big fan of animation, this film forces you to go outside your usual box. The artwork is stunning, allowing the viewer to see another world within the everyday reality. Overall, Miyazaki out did himself with this, and I recommend it to people of all ages.	2
1360	Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby	This movie may look like a bunch of nonsense and pointless dribble, but as it turns out, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is sure to take a throne next to other classic comedies like Anchorman and Happy Gilmore. Will Ferrel does an ostounding job as Ricky Bobby, #1 driver in NASCAR who is challenged when his manager hires a Frenchmen as a teammate. After many troubles both personally and professionally, its up to Ricky himslef to pull through and come out victorious. Top notch comedy.	2
1361	The Fighter	Its not about boxing its about life. Boxing is just a back drop in the movie while the real heart of the movie is the all the interaction going on in Micky's Wards family, the cast was great and Christian Bale just put on an all time great performance, congrats on the Oscar. Amazing life drama everyone should see even if you dont like boxing. 	2
1362	Margaret	Yeah, this film is absolutely incredible. Conversations as minefields, with the imprecision of language lending itself to the explosiveness of undiluted emotions, typified by the operatic heights of the central character's self-absorption. Life on the edges is a central feature here, with distraction paramount to the characters' lives, the messy sprawl impossible to escape or compartmentalize in a hopelessly fragmented existence.	0
1363	Wimbledon	Wimbledon't.	1
1364	Willow	This score is not unbiased. The movie isn't really a 75 good, but I grabbed my first boob while watching this on cable. First boob gets it a 75. 	2
1365	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	The last half-hour of this film as an absolute revelation. Not just the famous standoff scene, but the scene where Tuco first discovers the cemetery. I rewound that 3-minute scene 3 or 4 times. The direction was perfect, the music was better than perfect, Eli Wallach's expression is perfect. It sort of represents the movie in a microcosm. Westerns simply don't get much better than this trilogy of films.	0
1366	Children of Men	Sometimes there will be an asinine argument about whether or not popular entertainment can be artistically authentic anymore, either formally or aesthetically. Children of Men succeeds at all of that, primarily because every single thing about it is emotional. The way it is shot (beautifully immersive), the focus on and perspective of Theo (empathic) and the story that is told (inviting to an ethics dialogue).	2
1367	Taken	This action movie is an exhilirating film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only downfall of this movie is the typical unrealistic violence that each action movie has where the hero always prevails. However, Liam Neeson utilizes his skills in order to find his daughter, who has been taken into a world of drugs and prostitution. His determined attitude and unconditional love for his daughter are somwhat uplifting through an otherwise depressing situation. 	2
1368	Bully	Great acting and a very dark story make for an unforgettable film.  Granted, Larry Clark is a bit of a perv, and lingers perhaps uncomfortably long on the often-nude bodies of his teenage leads, but its worth it to watch career-making performances from Renfro, Phillips, Stahl and Leo Kirkpatrick.  Adults might hate to think this is realistic, but it is.	2
1369	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	vastly under-rated	1
1370	Napoleon Dynamite	Lacking the technical skill of Napoleon, and the pith of dynamite; this is one of the largest misnomers since Naked Lunch.	0
1371	The Dark Knight	Heath Ledger's performance is gripping in this film. He takes the role of the villain to a whole other level. I found myself rooting for the villain at times. It is a very dark film that has some flaws but is near perfect. Bale's gruffy voice is a bit annoying at times and the action sequences seem rushed. I believe Harvey Dent was killed off a little too soon, but Eckhart's performance as Dent was great. 	2
1372	Dirty Dancing	Dirty Dancing is a film set for the classics. Its set in a rich community where an individuals appearance is more important than their character. The main flaw I recognized in this film was the awkward relationship between Baby and Johnny. Johnny's character seems to be too mature for his relationship with Baby. The movie left me feeling weird and dissatisfied.	1
1373	The Breakfast Club	For such a simple plot, five kids in detention for a day, this movie is diverse and holds your attention.  What I like about it is you can easily indentify with at least one of the five main characters and they are constantly changing even though the movie only spans about six hours. 	1
1374	The Tree of Life	There is this guy on criticker that has this movie in his Tier 1. My initial reaction was to throw rocks at him. But then I decided that he should be forgiven. And that's how much influence this movie had on me. Mallick's world is full of awe and so should we be.	0
1375	Twilight	If you like sparkling vampires that don't drink human blood and like dating human girls, this movie is for you.  Based on the popular series that makes teenage girls go wild because of the perfect Edward Cullen, this movie is as laughable as the book.  While the movie is made to be a romance/drama, I laughed at the ridiculous behavior of the main characters.  There are some fun scenes based on super vampire speed, but for the most part the movie is choppy and full of awkward acting. 	0
1376	2001: A Space Odyssey	If you've read the book, you'll like this. If you haven't, large parts of this movie will be just unexplained, incomprehensible bullshit. The book doesn't require the movie, but the movie requires the book. That's a big flaw.	0
1377	Love and Basketball	This is one my all time favorite movies.This instant classic has all of the elements that make a great film.This is a love story about two people who live and breathe for only one reason, basketball.Well that is of course until they find another purpose for life in a thing called love.This film questions whether or not a person can love two things equally and not show favor over the other while they both pull at your heart and mind. In case you're still searching for an answer,watch the film.	2
1378	An Inconvenient Truth	If I wanted to see a powerpoint presentation, I'd get a job.	1
1379	Inland Empire	Disturbing and beautiful but so obtuse as to be utterly pointless. Story counts above pretty shots and atmospherre. If I wanted a creepy screensaver, I would download one. 	2
1380	John Tucker Must Die	John Tucker Must Die is a great combination of elements for a chick flick. Smokin' hot guy  cheating jerk  girls who want revenge= the perfect cquation for a movie in which most girls can relate. The plot never gets boring while the girls send John through escapades, like adversising that he has herpes or strapping him into a thong. The only complaint I have with this movie is John and Kate's relationship in the end. Nevertheless, this movie is great for a girls night in movie marathon.	1
1381	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a trip; an addictive drug trip. When you watch it the first time, it messes you up. Then you watch it again; the dialogue and action feels better, cleaner, and more comfortable. After the second time, you are hooked. I think this movie is intended to show you the dangers of drug usage on the job, but Depp's and del Toro's dead on druggie performances make any objectives stated in the movie completely irrelevant and interesting to watch.	1
1382	Love and Basketball	This is one my all time favorite movies.This instant classic has all of the elements that make a great film.This is a love story about two people who live and breathe for only one reason, basketball.Well that is of course until they find another purpose for life in a thing called love.This film questions whether or not a person can love two things equally and not show favor over the other while they both pull at your heart and mind. In case you're still searching for an answer,watch the film.	2
1383	Shame	come on.	1
1384	Up	About fifteen minutes into the film there is the most beautiful montage which represents Carl (The old man who decides to go on a adventure using balloons to life his house in the air) and his wife's entire relationship. That was the first time that I cried. This movie is beautiful and touching. Though animated it touches on human emotions in the way that many non animated films cannot do. It shows that you can combine stunning animation with making someone want to cry. 	2
1385	Get Out	W4E2P2S1V1M1A2R2.  If La La Land was the musical for the mainstream, this was the horror film for the mainstream.  So all the knocks on it lacking enough true horror are missing that the judicious use of jump scares and gore makes it more accessible to folks who would normally never go near a Saw movie.  I don't know if it was as clever as everyone says, but it was at least very tactful and broadly resonant.	0
1386	The Dark Tower	Meh.	1
1387	The Little Mermaid	The earliest of what I consider to be the trilogy of Disney greats (Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin round out that trilogy). The Little Mermaid mixes story telling, themes of growing up and parenting, and music that flows so well with the movie and is great even on its own. Truly Disney at its finest.	2
1388	Her	One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Best movie I saw this year by far. 	2
1389	The Wicker Man	"an ideal society tbh 
please set me on fire"	2
1390	The Revenant	arda kural kumsalda bira cigaralik yapsin leo ayiyla bogusuyor yerlerde surunuyor nicin cunku sinema bunu gerektirir. simdi gidip steven seagal'in hanimina cocuguna kopegine ahcisina tecavuz edilip oldurmeli, kendisinin komaya girmeli, iyilestiginde sakalli olmali ve intikam almali bir filmini izliyim	1
1391	Groundhog Day	More than the sum of its parts, this film defies description.  It's a very funny comedy, yes, but it's also got something true and wise to say about humanity.  If you haven't seen it, run, don't walk, to your video store!	1
1392	Goodfellas	There's the Godfather...the Godfather II..and Goodfellas.  Mob movies don't get any better.  How it didn't win a Best Picture Oscar or Best Director I will never know.  Pesci, De Niro and Liotta are all at the top of their game.  	0
1393	Batman Begins	Most certainly the way Batman was meant to be, Christian Bale for the win.	0
1394	Rampage	I joyfully and genuinely loved that movie. It was just that: pure joy, action, and kaiju beating the hell out of each other. Plus The Rock is in here so yeah.	2
1395	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood	Amazingly Pitt managed to outshine DiCaprio. The entire film should have focused on Pitt's character and been half as long. It might have been somewhat cohesive had that happened. As it is it looks like Tarantino had too many ideas and no one had the guts to tell him to pare them down. This was a mess.	0
1396	The Thing	Another horror/thriller classic from John Carpenter and a masterclass on how to do a remake to perfection. Kurt Russell is well cast in the lead role. It managed to be creepy, disturbing and intense all at the same time as well as a great sense of paranioa thoughtout the whole film as you are as much in the dark as the characters are in the film. After all it could be anyone. Also great old-school effects with still look pretty good and can still shock today. A great mix of horror, thiller and s	2
1397	Religulous	I'm not religious, but Mr Maher asks some quite unoriginal questions about the nature of religion and God, stuff I've heard in the playground at times. If you love to see Christians roasted on their beliefs, watch this docu, I personally found it irritating and very one sided, some parts about USA history was interesting though, Bill is an annoying cock who's a bit thick and likes the sound of himself a bit much for my liking, could've been great, but for me it was granny pants.	1
1398	2001: A Space Odyssey	dude we re in 2007 and nothing happened	1
1399	Toy Story 3	Prepare for one emotional trip. Throughout the years Pixar has made us  part of Woody and the gang. And seeing Andy all grown up affects not just the toys, but us as well. Non-stop laughs, and moments where you'll wanna cry. Fantastic. Worth the 10 year wait. So worth it.	2
1400	2001: A Space Odyssey	dude we re in 2007 and nothing happened	1
1401	Hoop Dreams	Beyond perfect.  And, every scene is true.  Lovely, lovely, lovely stuff.  	2
1402	The Amazing Spider-Man	It's a mixed bag of stuff we have here. At times the direction and script is downright cringeworthy and at times the action and cinematogaphy are fantasically well done. I'm sort of ambivalent about Garfield, but luckily he is backed by a great supporting cast. Stone, Leary, Davis and Sheen all do an amazing job here. I do miss some of the charm and tongue-in-cheekness of the Raimi movies, but overall it's a very solid reboot, flaws and all. Better than Spider-Man 3 in any case.	2
1403	Audition	Takashi Miike work with this in a very patient and careful manner; easing and coddling you to acquiescence, but then to your shock a quick but violent abandonment into the abyss envelops; keeping you on the edge of your sanity while you the viewer futilely tries to distinct reality from dream. The subtly drawn in but wicked finale is a separate entity but without the pieces of the puzzle that bring you there, you'd be begging Asami to take you deeper, deeper, deeper.	1
1404	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A rehash of Episode 4 .. with elemrnts from the other episodes. Clearly the story was constructed from a formula based on all the elements that were popular in the first 6 installments. All aimed at selling the movie to the largest number of fans . Hardly anything original and way below the standards of any of Lucas' movies.  Sad really.. enjoyable in a pop candy sort if way.. like watching a cartoon...	0
1405	Gone Girl	I bet that was NPH's real house.	1
1406	Jurassic World	The end scene was epic and how it had to be. I am surprised at the lower ratings for this. Beats by Dre.	1
1407	Jodorowsky's Dune	This was supposed to be the BEST movie ever made, with the BEST music of its time, with the BEST design and the BEST camera work possible, but we weren't able to do it in the end because Hollywood is the WORST.   Honestly, I really don't find listening to people trying to justify the importance of a work (we will never see) for an hour and a half worth my time. This isn't art, this is ego inflation.  	0
1408	Red Dawn	Not really any different than the one-dimensional flag waving movies you see elsewhere. A shame, too. Amazing premise.	0
1409	Sucker Punch	I believe this movie to be a misjudged classic (and there are reasons for it). Inception is a journey in the mind; this is a journey in the soul. With style completely shadowing the substance of this gem (and, again, I suppose the director had a purpose in doing this), this movie requires more than just one-watch to reach its heart. Take some time out, unclutter your mind about the opinions others have about this movie, and judge again. I am sure, you'll be prepared this time.	2
1410	The Thing	Atmosphere - Check. Tension - Check. Aliens - Check. Awesome special effects - Check. Kurt Russel with an awesome Jesus Beard - double check on that one baby. How could this not be great?	2
1411	Inception	I would dare to say that exactly 97.8% of people who have seen this movie finished it and their immediate reaction was a variation of wtf and my mind just exploded. This mind-blowing movie was so far from the ordinary that I had to see it at least three times to even comprehend it. Inception has probably inspired our generation to attempt extraction; whether this is a good thing or bad is totally debatable. My one quandary with this movie is it's a very stereotypical Leo DiCaprio role.	0
1412	Finding Nemo	A great Pixar film, Finding Nemo was both thrilling and didactic. The quality animation of the film was amazing. The movie seemed so real. The adventures of Nemo, his father and Dori, were entertaining. The creativity that produced the personifications of the underwater world was stunning. The movie stressed the love for a child by a parent. Parents will go to the end of the world for their offspring. This is a great film for young children, as well as adults, its a family fun movie. 	2
1413	RoboCop	Paul Verhoeven, who also directed Starship Troopers and Total Recall, explores some of the goofiest action territory around, and then proceeds to gift his films with insane, over-the-top subtext critical of such topics as fascism and violence in the media. It's brilliant how much an unsubtle sledgehammer like this can still go over people's heads. Almost as brilliant as the film itself, one of the great 80's actioners.	2
1414	Idiocracy	Awesome ideas in a stupid packaging. Could have been truly shining satire if it weren't so... well... dumb. That said; a pimp's life ain't easy.	2
1415	The Nutcracker in 3D	Vienna. The 1920s. Albert Einstein sings about his Theory of Relativity to his niece, who promptly discovers a world of proto-Nazi space-ranger rats led by a nasty, singing Andy Warhol rodent. But I don't have to tell you the beloved story of The Nutcracker.	1
1416	Marley & Me	Dreadful sapfest, stick-thin human characters.	0
1417	2012	Damn you Emmerich! You can't cheat me with your shitty effects. That is completely terrible.	2
1418	Forrest Gump	Unmissable. Forrest Gump teaches us that even with a low IQ, you can still live an exceptionally large life. One single man's journey through live while learning big lessons about love and trust. Serious at all the right moments, but has plenty of comedy. Romantic and historic. Not to mention, great music!	2
1419	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	The multiverse narrative is the film's greatest strength and weakness. Visually stunning is an understatement; each dimensional character is a playful love-letter to Spiderman, animation, and comics as a whole. Yet the film partakes in that modern trend of ironically and coyly acknowledging its own cultural ubiquity. This is yet another Spiderman film, but one that hurries to reassure and comfort its viewers for watching it.	2
1420	The Nutcracker in 3D	Vienna. The 1920s. Albert Einstein sings about his Theory of Relativity to his niece, who promptly discovers a world of proto-Nazi space-ranger rats led by a nasty, singing Andy Warhol rodent. But I don't have to tell you the beloved story of The Nutcracker.	1
1421	Remember the Titans	While Remember the Titans is based on football, there are many lessons to be learned throughout the film.  Remember the Titans shows many inspiration football scenes that may send chills down your back as you're watching.  Away from football, Remember the Titans gives you an up close experience of the life in high school students during the time of racial integration.  I give this movie a hands-down rating of 5 stars. 	2
1422	The Hangover	The Hangover may be crude and inappropriate to some, but it is downright hilarious. Taking you through the journey of 4 friends in Vegas, viewers get a little reality of how crazy bachelor parties can be. Waking up with no recollection of what happened the night before, they must trace back their steps in order to find their lost friend. A series of funny,  and sometimes disturbing events finally leads them to their final destination. This is not suitable for all ages, but is a damn funny movie.	2
1423	The Empty Hearse	Spends too much time addressing the season 2 cliffhanger, but it's great to have these character back. The direction and visual style is incredible as always, but the main plot in this one is minimal.	1
1424	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	A funny almost-parody of Film Noir, this movie has excellent work from Robert Downey Jr., especially with his charmingly bumbling narration.	2
1425	The Lost Room	Short but sweet - other irritatingly long running series that started strong could take a cue from this!	0
1426	Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi	this rating is part nostalgia and part fanboy, but man do i love these movies	2
1427	Inception	The new favorite film of 15-year-old philosophers	1
1428	The Host	Originally they had several scripts: (1) generic mosnter blockbuster; (2) moving tale about a girl dying from a deadly virus-disease; (3) comedy about a middle-aged, kind-hearted loser living with his father; (4) story of a talented female archer fighting her way for an olympic success; (5) story of a revolutionary fighting with the scientists doing experiments on human animals. But then they realised that there's no money nor time to do all those films so they said fuck it and produced the Host	1
1429	Conquest	Whoever was running the fog machine had a blast	1
1430	X-Men Origins: Wolverine	"Wolverine is  a bloated film with too many characters and dosen't spend enough time on Wolverine himself. With its forgettable and  brainless plot, it's not a movie that leaves you satisfied which is quite a shame when you consider its potential. Nothing in Wolverine stands out as memorable. In terms of tone and content, Wolverine is a close match to Daredevil and Ghost Rider. Wolverine was made by people more interested in money than telling a coherent story so the movie suffers for it.
 "	0
1431	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	The critics said it was much better than the previous 2. Much was an overstatement, it's only slightly better.	0
1432	The Avengers	Oh, go fuck yourselves.	1
1433	[Rec]	Holy nightmares, thank god I didn't see this late at night. Grating characters, plenty of dumbass dialogue, but jesus, this thing is scary. And claustrophobic. That final stand in the dark is very, very uncomfortable to watch. Great job.	0
1434	A Quiet Place	A mess from beginning to end with acting that wouldn't even make the cut on a children's television program. They slap together a bunch of generic monster traits and quickly disregard any sort of logic that they themselves establish in order to create an atmosphere that is more laughable than anything else.  Good horror is about world and character building, which are both obviously absent in this mess of a film.	0
1435	My Neighbor Totoro	This is what you really want a childhood to be. Miyazaki tells a story of two tough little girls still free from the bounderies of adulthood with none of the goody two shoes morals of disney. With its natrual beauty and playfullness Miyazaki does not only tell a story to children but also to adults about what kids are like and could rather be compared to author Astrid Lindgren than the disney co. he so often wrongfully is compared to.	1
1436	Annie Hall	Insufferably terrible, how does anyone rate this? Woody Allen is painful, not acting but just pretending, the film stops every time he is in the scene, which is nearly every scene. Possibly interesting a preseient of the looser-world films of the 2000-2010 period. The characterizations are weak to the point of flimsy, the script is poor. The only interesting thing is ... some people can actually tolerate... and then like... this film!!!	0
1437	A Simple Favor	Annoying from the outset. Emily's character looks to pull this film out of the doldrums in the third act with hopefully some revelations about her being involved in some secret underworld, given the character she is portraying from the start, but it just descends into hand wringing slop. Everything then turns to farce and the whole thing falls flat.	0
1438	Sinister	This Scott Derrickson has pretty good taste in music, with Ulver, Sunn O)))/Boris, and Boards of Canada all making appearances. On top of that, the story he's adapting is strong and something I find really interesting. Shame that everything else about this film is fundamentally trite.	2
1439	Jurassic Park	Come on its jurassic park!	1
1440	The Thin Red Line	Maybe the only war movie I've seen that doesn't take death for granted. 	0
1441	Annie Hall	Insufferably terrible, how does anyone rate this? Woody Allen is painful, not acting but just pretending, the film stops every time he is in the scene, which is nearly every scene. Possibly interesting a preseient of the looser-world films of the 2000-2010 period. The characterizations are weak to the point of flimsy, the script is poor. The only interesting thing is ... some people can actually tolerate... and then like... this film!!!	0
1442	Scary Movie	This parody is a great comedy that combines many different other movies' plots into one movie.  It mocks these movies such as scream, dawsons creek, and i know what you did last summer.  it is extemely funny and the first time i watched it i laughed almost the entire time.	2
1443	Sunset Blvd.	A summit of self-reflexive cinema, aided in no small part by Wilder's genius casting (who better to play a destitute silver screen legend and a fallen titan of the silent era than... a destitute silver screen legend and a fallen titan of the silent era?) This is mise-en-abime at its most vertiginous.	2
1444	My Sister's Keeper	Get your box of tissues ready because it is impossible to watch My Sister's Keeper without getting emotional.  The plot of the movie is easy to follow and the film does a superb job of portraying the struggles that people with cancer have to face before death.  Cameron Diaz along with the other actors all give such stellar performances and even won a Grammy for their roles in this movie.  Even though this is an extremely sad film, it is a motivating story and I highly recommend watching it.	2
1445	Pulse	"Wes Craven has to be drunk when writing this. It's about electromagnetic ghosts which are coming from the internet. Well done Mr. Craven, now Japanese kids are asking those kind of questions. ''Can ghosts inhabit the internet? Can a ghost haunt a website and communicate through the internet?'' The answer is YES, of course. This movie deserved an Academy Award and this review has written by an angry extra who hates lead ghosts in that movie boo, right. * Casting, Acting : 2
* Script : 1
* Direc"	2
1446	Upgrade	This movie shows that original movies can be fulfilling and quite good. Its getting tiring to view all these saga movies & Fast & the Furious 55. Upgrade is highly recommended with a great story, great ideas, and tons of creativity. 	2
1447	Garfield	Made me want to beat myself with an aluminum bat.	2
1448	T2 Trainspotting	Great to see the places that I know in Edinburgh and a fun and funny watch but not spectacular, doesn't hold up to the original though the cast is brilliant and the characters great. I like the contrast with the first film too, in many ways.	2
1449	Primer	score is PSI, rede: IK BEGRIJP ER GENE KAK VAN, ma ik denk da em wel goe is als k em snap, de score zal dus da een volgende kijk beurt worden aangepast :)	0
1450	Guardians of the Galaxy	Dave Bautista was my favorite, he had me laughing at every line.  I do like the fun style of rag-tag heroes, refreshing. It moved along, but still felt like it was just act one to a bigger story--one that I'm excited to see more of, but still a little lacking as a stand-alone story.  Very funny script, good visuals, good acting. Characters need a little more fleshing out, so hopefully we will get more of that in Part 2.	0
1451	Richie Rich	one of my greatest childhood memories involves trying to build the giant child catapult featured in this movie and then settling for jumping off the roof of the house while holding an umbrella. My shoulder still hurts when the weather changes.	2
1452	Rampage	Just dumb as hell, and not even very fun to make up for it.	0
1453	Raiders of the Lost Ark	One of my few perfect movies. It has everything, action, adventure, romance, evil British guy. The perfect complement to a lazy saturday afternoon.	2
1454	Vampyr	86.875	1
1455	Interstellar	it's overrated...	1
1456	Red	A well blended mix of comedy and action.	2
1457	Hereditary	Similar to Ouija: Origin of Evil in that I was enjoying it so much as a family drama that I felt it lost something when the genre elements showed up. It takes a while to reveal its hook and when it does it's disappointingly familiar. The first half is so great though - steadily builds an atmosphere of wrongness though off-kilter editing and tense, uncomfortable character dynamics. There's also one sequence that shook me in a way a horror film hasn't for a while.	2
1458	Pokémon the First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back	Come on, it's a first class entertaining movie.	2
1459	Pan's Labyrinth	Superb story and well presented.  Loved it.	2
1460	Saving Private Ryan	Good for a war movie. Most such moves tend to glorify way, this movie you a little sense of the terrible futility. 	2
1461	Inception	Inception might not have everything you want to see in a movie, but it has everything you expect to get out of it. Gripping, intense and massively entertaining. A breath of fresh air in an otherwise lack luster opening half of the year. As for those who find the movie too complex, you don't need to get it, you just have to enjoy the experience.	2
1462	AVP: Alien vs. Predator	This movie lost a lot of points because it had no excuse not being the greatest movie of all time. Why? Because Alien was an incredibly cool movie, and predator is one of my favorite movies of all time. Put the two together and you should have serendipity. AvP just kind of sucked. What's up with that?	1
1463	The World of Apu	The best of the trilogy and one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. There's a great scene followed by a great scene followed by a great scene... Best moment: Near the beginning, when Apu tells Pulu what his book is going to be about, and he talks about the main character (based off of himself) and softly you can hear the music from the first movie - CHILLS!	2
1464	Wings of Desire	Got this from Video Ezy the other day. I liked the bird fucking in Pink Flamingos so I took this title literally - big mistake. I thought the Germans were renowned for their fetishes, so Wim Wenders has come as a substantial disappointment to me. 	0
1465	Seven Samurai	Incredible.  Everyone should see it.	2
1466	Mad Max: Fury Road	Wow! What an action movie! So many of the great things one remembers of the Road Warrior and done so well in a new version of Mad Max. Loved it!	2
1467	Deadpool	It's not very edgy, just rather tepid in its genre transgressions. Some of it is very fun, but the thin plot and half-baked characters aren't handled so gracefully. Poor use of non-chronologic story-telling. Rather than pacing the weak origin out as best as possible, it keeps cutting back and forth from the present (ie. the fun stuff) to the past (ie. the boring stuff) the whole movie. It's an irritating, tedious tease that culminates abruptly in an underwhelming climax.	0
1468	Gravity	Cuaron has done it again! His films are beautifully shot. I instantly had an uneasy feeling due to the ominous knowledge of what was to come.This feeling then transitioned to both fear and exhilaration as Clooney and Bullock fight to survive. When the lights came up I was still clutching my seat with sweat on my brow. Seeing this in IMAX 3D is a must. I can only hope this film is shown in theaters for years to come so I can relive that experience. What a rush! 	2
1469	Mother!	Supremely unsettling.	1
1470	Mother!	A beautiful and tragic allegory for the book of Genesis, presenting mother! as mother nature, the Man as God, the almighty creator, the first couple(Harris, Pfeiffer) as Adam and Eve, their sons as Abel and Cain, the occurings as global warming and the alarming message that nothing will change, we will parish and hopefully a better life will appear. A nice gem from the film would be the powder that mother was using in order to calm herself, which represents faith.	2
1471	Drive	Despite an incredible soundtrack and dark brooding type cinematography, the plot was nonexistent and dialogue often lacklustre with Gosling preferring to stare at people for several seconds. Not sure where the 80's theme came from but it didn't really fit anywhere. Poor movie and not worth a watch. 	0
1472	Scary Movie 5	While not a shining moment in the series its still a funny parody film with enough to keep you entertained and amused as long as you don't take it too seriously.	2
1473	The Godfather: Part III	Better than most people would have you believe.	2
1474	Shaun of the Dead	Hilarious!	2
1475	Inception	Christopher Nolan's epic sci-fi thriller is a triumph of plotting, stunts, effects, acting, direction and score. A sublimely audacious piece of film-making. 	2
1476	Samurai Cop	This movie is what would happen if the guys from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia followed through on their Dolph Lundgren movie where it switches back and forth between fighting crime and penetration until it just sort of ends. Overall, Samurai Cop is a solid B-movie with some slow stretches, but many great scenes with amazingly inept dialogue.	0
1477	Man of Steel	Probably my all time favorite episode of Dragonball Z.	2
1478	The Hunchback of Notre Dame	A wonderfully colorful and entertaining, but surprisingly dark entry by Disney.	2
1479	Willow	Words cannot express how happy this movie makes me	2
1480	The Hunchback of Notre Dame	A wonderfully colorful and entertaining, but surprisingly dark entry by Disney.	2
1481	Hot Rod	horrible	0
1482	The Prestige	I can't say enough good things about this brilliant film from Chris Nolan.  The acting from Caine, Jackman and Bale was top notch, the cinematography was dark and gritty in a way that complemented the story, and the story itself (adapted from Priest's novel) was complex and clever.  My only complaint is that I'd have liked a stronger score, but the bits that I did hear augmented the visuals well enough.  Easily one of the best movies of 2006.	2
1483	The Last House on the Left	Scene one reminded me of Tales from the Dark Side episodes only the acting was much more painful to watch, the writing plain mortifying, and I have no idea what was happening with the sound. Then of course there's the music, which had obviously no relation whatsoever to what was happening in the film. After this point every scene just keeps sliding further  and further into a dubious sinkhole with no hope for retaliation after the bitter and alas so long awaited for wretched ending. 	0
1484	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	Why doesn't this work better than it does? Seems like it should, but it simply does not grab.	0
1485	Shaun of the Dead	A comedy about zombies is simply pure genious, and the balance between the comedy and the horror is done so well in this movie that it deserved to have a cult following.	2
1486	The Burning	If Friday the 13th didn't suck and featured Jason Alexander.	0
1487	Young Adult	Unpleasant in a hostile way.  Little more than a 90 minute Diet Coke commercial.	0
1488	Leaving Las Vegas	One of the most depressing films I have ever seen.	0
1489	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	This has to be one of the most fun movies I've seen in years.  I was blown away at how much I enjoyed it that I immediately hit play and watched it again.  It's a great film for multiple viewings because it is tight, funny, and an all around good time.	2
1490	The Burning	If Friday the 13th didn't suck and featured Jason Alexander.	0
1491	Clash of the Titans	First of all, way to hype up the Kraken you Hollywood douchebags! I think they totally missed the point of this story. It's not about a giant sea monster. It's about a man accomplishing things that should be impossible with the help of the gods. I just looooove how Perseus had never held a sword in this movie and then after one training sesh he's able to take on just about anything. I don't give a fuck if the movie is in 3-D, the plot was laughable and it deviated way too much from the myth.	0
1492	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo	Well-made, but the persistent misogynist violence displayed towards the female protagonist and women in general, while condemned, is difficult to handle. Also, the condemnation seems a bit over-reaching, as though the film feels it has to tell us that violence towards women is wrong because we otherwise wouldn't be able to figure that out.	0
1493	Wanted	Wanted is as predictable as a daytime soap opera with sequences that scream their arrival about a good 10 minutes earlier, let alone the actual story. After a 50 odd year career, Terence Stamp still acts as well as a shower curtain. I give all 9 points to McAvoy's torso only.	1
1494	Beetlejuice	One thing I noticed right away about Beetlejuice (1988) is that the death scene that begins the movie is done much better than any Hollywood horror movie has done recently. It's not bloody or brutal - instead it's just a happily married couple in the prime of their lives suddenly dying in a car accident. It's something that could honestly happen to anybody, and I find that pretty creepy.  Good movie. I recommend.	2
1495	Slumdog Millionaire	This movie shows viewers that anything is possible. Even if you've come from having nothing, you still have a chance of winning a million dollars. The more experience you have in life, the more knowledge you gain throughout. This movie was a great representation of that, and gives people hope that anything is possible. The concept of using the game show was a great idea, and the plot was set up very nicely. 	2
1496	Skyline	It's War of the Worlds except everyone is Dakota Fanning.	1
1497	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey	Instead of an exteded cut, a reduced cut might be good for a SE release next year.	0
1498	Jack and Jill	"Adam Sandler is going from bad to worst.
Unless he starts to take more clever decision (script, director etc) it's better paying him to stay home instead of paying him to act."	0
1499	300	Fills a much-needed gap between gay porn and recruitment film.	0
1500	Blow	A great movie. I'm taking it the last 5 points only because it was so sad that I got depressed long after it and the final scenes really made me weep a lot!	2
1501	John Carter	Fun and fascinating adventure whose greatest charm is not to be ashamed of bringing fantasy to the limit. A mix of non-stop action with old-fashioned romance in a movie made with cutting-edge special effects.	2
1502	Blood Diamond	This was a very emotional and riviting story, involving a father searching for his lost family in the heart of Sierra Leone, as well as one man's quest to try and strike it rich.  It is a culturally relevent movie, one which gives its viewers a little insight in the world's most bloody and violent currency.  The obsticles which lay in the way of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou will keep you entertained from start to finish.	2
1503	The Red and the White	Both conceptually and technically stunning, this is one of the bleakest war films I've ever seen. Both sides commit atrocities, often within the same shot. New characters are rarely named; they'll be dead soon, anyway. The camera winds along the banks of the Volga like death itself, following people until they die, then leeching onto surrounding survivors until they die as well. Everyone is linked in a seamless stream of brutality. War, fuck yeah.	2
1504	Kazaam	Cinematic genius at it's finest people.	2
1505	Bee Movie	...a lot of diversionary mayhem in the final 10 minutes ... can't disguise the fact that the movie is forced by its own volition to do an about-face and celebrate the very conformity that it had earlier dismissed.	2
1506	Joker	Halfway through my screening of Joker, an incel ran into the theater with an AR-15 aimed at the audience and shouted Gamers rise up! But upon seeing Joaquin Phoenix's excellent acting, he lowered his gun, sat down and watched. At the end of the film, he stood up, with tears in his eyes, and apologized to everyone. I'm sorry, he said. I guess we really do live in a society after all.	1
1507	Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi	David Lynch was initially slated to direct this. I often lay awake at night, wondering..	2
1508	A Nightmare on Elm Street	It's always hard to know what to rate this movie because I hate to watch it, it's way too scary, but it's a horror movie, so it succeeded at being the scariest movie ever!	2
1509	Sin City	This is all flash and no substance, more worthwhile as a novelty piece than as a legitimately involving feature. A delight to gaze upon, but just as hazily put together on a writing level, the picture moves forward while standing still. Heavy misogynistic overtones -- practically all of the female cast members are playing prostitutes -- are unavoidably off-putting, as well.	1
1510	Furry Vengeance	"Furry Vengeance is a slapstick stinker, easily the worst movie of the year.

1511	Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives	For the first 3/4 of the movie, think a David Lynch but Thai and 2010 and you're not far off.  The ending went from bad to worse.  WHY do we need to watch some guy shower for like five minutes!?!?!  Shots are WAY too long throughout, no real plot.  Went from dozing off to straight WTF?? moments in about 5 seconds flat a couple times.  Many references you probably need to be intimately familiar with Thai culture/history to understand, such as the military guys, no idea wtf that came from...	0
1512	Jaws	It made people scared of going swimming. Seriously.	1
1513	A Nightmare on Elm Street	It's always hard to know what to rate this movie because I hate to watch it, it's way too scary, but it's a horror movie, so it succeeded at being the scariest movie ever!	2
1514	Sin City	This is all flash and no substance, more worthwhile as a novelty piece than as a legitimately involving feature. A delight to gaze upon, but just as hazily put together on a writing level, the picture moves forward while standing still. Heavy misogynistic overtones -- practically all of the female cast members are playing prostitutes -- are unavoidably off-putting, as well.	1
1515	Hot Rod	I personally can't get enough of this movie.  The Lonely Island boys and the rest of the cast do an amazing job of creating unique characters that stick with you for a while.  If you like a good laugh and don't mind borderline childish humor every now and then - much like myself - then I'd recommend it.	1
1516	Moonrise Kingdom	It's hard for me to imagine why this movie gets such great reviews.  I saw it in the theater yesterday and the the only redeeming factor of the whole experience was that I saw it for free.  The audience was roaring with laughter at such inane humor that it was surreal.  Although I grew up most of my life in the States, I think this brand of humor is really quite thinly American.  I thought the story was quite rubbish and the quirkiness which I appreciate in moderate doses was really over the top	0
1517	King Kong	Takes three hours to do what could comfortably be done in 2. Cinematics etc are good, as you'd expect from Jackson, but ultimately it bores me. Not his best effort by any measure of the imagination.	0
1518	Terminator: Dark Fate	Dans le genre, c'est du très bon Pop Corn ! Linda Hamilton avait raison, Terminator 4 et 5, c'est vraiment de la merde à côté de Dark Fate. 	1
1519	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Succeeds completely at being a Star Wars tribute, but as a movie it's lacking. There's not much of a buildup to the final confrontation(s), as the action is ramped up right from the start. I wish the main plot of the movie wasn't so high stakes - what are they going to do in the sequels? The main characters gain skills out of nowhere. Still, there's great visuals, good dialogue, likable characters well acted - but only in service of a passable, not great, story and plot.	2
1520	Black Dynamite	This movie is hilarious and the jokes just keep appearing after multiple viewings.	2
1521	Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter	"Oh boy, my eyes started hurting after the number of times I rolled them during this movie. The main actor was dull; reminded me of a Liam Neeson/Paul Dano hybrid that can't act. A few interesting ideas thrown in at the end (vampires fighting the battle of Gettysburg), but beyond that pretty boring.

Edit: Just IMDB'd the actor: He played a young Liam Neeson in 'Kinsey'."	0
1522	Mandy	I have a lot of records that sound just like this movie	1
1523	The Revenant	An asteroid, an avalanche, a National Geographic, and then the horse hotel.	0
1524	Frankenweenie	I normally like Tim Burton movies, but this story did not work for me.  It was an homage to the monster genre, but there wasn't enough new and interesting to make it really very worthwhile.	1
1525	True Romance	Gritty film and excellent performances from everyone involved in this film. The dialogue between Walken and Hopper alone is worth giving this film a watch.	2
1526	Zombieland: Double Tap	Solid movie that brings back exactly what we all loved about the original. The original is better more for the freshness of it, but otherwise the sequel completely captures what we all loved about the original, with some cool new ideas thrown in too. Abigail Breslin is easily the weakest link among the cast, unfortunately. I don't think that's necessarily her fault, but that her arc just wasn't great. The other leads are fantastic, and Zoey Deutch's character brings some extra fun as well. 	2
1527	Batman Begins	"Certainly the most accurate adaptation of Batman ever done, this is also one of the best.  Perhaps not as exciting as some might find the original Tim Burton Batman, but a very well made, well acted film that successfully reboots the Batman series.

Worth checking out if your only knowledge of Batman resides with the Burton films (or worse, the Schumacher ones), or if you like comic book movies in general."	2
1528	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	actually watched it... even after hating the first one... this time around there was 2 robots with racial stereotypes instead of 1.... awesome... 	1
1529	A Star Is Born	After watching most of the previous versions of A Star Is Born, I was able to appreciate the newest one more the second time around. In comparison, it's the deepest, most important version to date. If you haven't seen it yet, it's really worth taking the time to see in theaters. You won't regret it.	2
1530	Inside Llewyn Davis	Everything in this film was beautifully shot. Songs're lovely. The story unfolded in an interesting order, as expected from Coen Brothers. There're some boring bits halfway through the film but the overall pace's decent. The key success of this film is the ability to tell a realistic story. You don't always get what you want in life.   	2
1531	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	they played it safe with the last one so that ppl knew this wouldnt be like the prequels. now they made a more daring film that i think is one of the highlights of the whole series. a lot goes on here, i agree maybe a little too much. but i liked the diversion with tran's character, good subplot that in a loose way has implications for the rest. was weird to see finn be kinda demoted in plot importance tho. connection to the old tril felt more substantial, tying things together. and laura dern!	0
1532	Memento	Very clever, well written story and a witty concept. Masterclass original cinema from the man who made Batman cool.	2
1533	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	It has good moments but overally I'm disappointed. 	2
1534	Daisies	Another brilliant new wave film from Jean-Luc Godard. Thank god it's one of his pure fun films and isn't about sociopolitical concerns at all. Marie is the better-acted of the two, although her French doesn't sound at all like French. I put this down to poor direction on Godard's part. 	2
1535	Dope	Very original, laugh-out-loud hilarious, and wonderfully written. I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, especially because the main cast of characters (esp. the main protagonist) was so likeable and endearing. The message at the end is very hard-hitting and relevant. I really hope a lot of people see this movie. It does not deserve to be forgotten.	2
1536	Moulin Rouge!	This is a bright, shinily-wrapped piece of crap.  Over-produced, over-acted, over-hyped nonsense of the worst variety.  It is intensely boring and long and has some sort of a plot apparently, sandwiched in between mediocre Elton John songs redone in a manner to make middle-aged housewives think it is apparently a brilliant movie.	0
1537	Avatar	I'm somewhat conflicted here. The visuals were stunning. Gorgeous. For me however, the 3D was somewhat disorienting at times, and being a glasses wearer, it's not the most comfortable experience. I got used to it though, and by the second half of the movie I stopped noticing the 3D as much and became truly immersed in the world. There were some cliches in the story and dialogue, but I found the overall effect to still be quite compelling.	1
1538	Pan's Labyrinth	Horrible, beautiful, awful, fantastic film. I expected to see a cutesy fantasy film, so I was shocked. Both the story in the fantasy world and the real world are gripping and exciting. I had nightmares (!) about The Pale Man and couldn't stand people putting their hands up in front of their eyes for months. The real world villain is just as scary. Heart-breaking to see the magical childhood-fantasy-world shattered. I was moved and scared to tears - thumbs up!	2
1539	Avatar	The Matrix meets Dances With Wolves and xy other movies. But hey...you aren't there to see a new story. And to be honest, even though it screams hollywood, the movie stays entertaining for those three hours thanks to the effects. By the way, has anyone else seen those $ bills popping out of the flowers and waterfalls? Well, might be my imagination...	0
1540	Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald	You'd expect any second movie to build upon the first one. That doesn't happen here. The relationships established in the first movie are pushed to the background and the movie focuses on sooo many new characters and their backstories that it's hard to keep track of them. It gets a bit better by the end, but even the plot itself feels like a prelude to a much greater thing - something that isn't even published yet - and it forgot to have an interesting story just on its own.	1
1541	Interstellar	(Read in Christopher Nolan's awful England accent) NOLAN: OY! LOOK AT ME! I'M FOOKIN KUBRICK! OI'VE GOT A WEIRD FOOKIN SOUNDTRACK AND ME EDITIN'S ALL TE COCK. But I've also put in a story about t' family trauma so all yowse regular tossers can appreciate it. I'm a fookin genius, me. 	2
1542	Black Panther	I really had my hopes up for this movie, but I was utterly disappointed. The story was nothing like I expected, too many characters and very weird combinations of hi-tech and undeveloped tribal behavior. The character of T'Challa's sister Shuri was very annoying and it felt like actress Leticia Wright was exaggerating all the time. 	0
1543	Children of Men	Cuaron's uninterrupted shot in Bexhill is among the most magnificently-filmed scenes of the last 20 years. Excellent cinematography, gripping plot, solid performances. 	2
1544	The Death of Stalin	A superb farce; the cast is excellent, the dialogue is snappy, and the humour is very droll. I do however think that this movie would feel more at home on stage. I'm not sure how historically accurate the architecture is (more than the accents but less than the events, I'd guess), but in big scenes I thought it the cinematography seemed more claustrophobic than grandiose - which perhaps was the point - and that the third act lacked an emotional punch at key moments, hence the 80/100 rating.  	0
1545	The Thing	God damn John Carpenter is awesome and this movie is awesome.	2
1546	Stalag 17	After my first time watching this film, my thought was simply Awesome! I have seen 3 other films from Billy Wilder and I liked them all and Stalag 17 can join the list. I guess me and Billy Wilder shared the same taste in what we want to see in a movie; some drama, some comedy and a little thrill here and there. I just found out William Holden won Best Actor for his role in this movie though I felt like he didn't get much screen time to do a good performance. Good for him.	2
1547	Tremors	Rarely is the monster-movie genre this fun, or this engaging.	2
1548	Jason and the Argonauts	I like it. Then again I saw it for the first time when I was 10 or 11. Kind of goofy at times, but its a fun adventure for every one who likes Greek mythology. 	2
1549	Mission: Impossible	Within the first five minutes Emilio Estevez is dead. At this point, I'm thinking to myself, This could be the greatest movie ever made.	0
1550	Seven Samurai	It is always hard to approach a legendary piece of cinema, difficult to fight the easy options of blithe acceptance of popular opinion or cynical rejection of it. Certainly, Seven Samurai is thoroughly engrossing, like all great films of this length, with few glances at the watch throughout. There are individual action scenes which really stand out. On first viewing, I was not completely convinced of the film's oft-referenced philosophical weight, however this may well change upon second viewing	2
1551	The Road Home	A love story that stood against everything in a rough environment.	2
1552	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	I am fed up with Star Wars and all that money-sucking movies over and over re-created and  resurrected. It may be good for newbies or those who are keen in it. But for me it was just ordeal to sit in cinema whole 2 and half hours and watching all that fights over and over as I watched many many times before in many many other movies of this kind. And I got this feeling that it is just cheesy and created for product placements and merchandising purpose. And maybe to keep people in wanna-war state	0
1553	Real Steel	If this movie was simply about a jackass version of Hugh Jackman using robots to box and then having his heart softened, this movie would have been awesome. However, they screwed it up with a freaking kid and a father/son sob story. 	2
1554	Batman Returns	Feels too much like a Tim Burton movie with Batman characters  than a true Batman movie.  Burton's unique visuals don't really harm this movie but it does end up making it too much of his own style than that of the source material.  Aside from these comments the story was good and the cast was pretty much spot on for their respective characters.  This film also suffered slightly from the usual cheesiness that is present in all forms of Batman.  	0
1555	The Killing of a Sacred Deer	Director's jerking off way too much.	0
1556	Avengers: Age of Ultron	I laughed and I cried. I also enjoyed it, which was basically all I wanted from it.	2
1557	Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog	Fun movie, catchy songs. I very thoroughly enjoyed it.	2
1558	Kingdom of Heaven	One instance where the Director's Cut is significantly better than the Theatrical.	2
1559	Epic Movie	Two words descibe this movie: Epic Fail.	1
1560	Martha	This is my wife's favorite movie.	2
1561	2001: A Space Odyssey	Waited a LONG time to see this and it massively underwhelmed me.  I was ready for some sci-fi awesomeness, but I found myself falling asleep.  Will watch again to confirm at some point, but not my type of movie at all - sorry fanboys...  I'm sure it's very deep, symobolic, clever, blah blah, but it's just not very interesting to me.  That is the primary requirement of a movie to me: it must keep me interested/entertained.  If I want to see art, there are plenty of museums around...	0
1562	The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant	This film is soooooo intense.	2
1563	Batman Returns	Feels too much like a Tim Burton movie with Batman characters  than a true Batman movie.

1564	The Killing of a Sacred Deer	Director's jerking off way too much.	0
1565	Starship Troopers	a gore fest that exploited the book in every way possible.	1
1566	Cinema Paradiso	you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years... When you come back, everything's changed.The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone...	0
1567	Kick-Ass	*Possible Spoiler Review*  Any film which has a small child say the word cunt before brutally murdering around half a dozen people is instantly a great film in my eyes.	2
1568	Happy Death Day	Basically teen movie but really good with outstanding lead. Could use better bad guy, but still nice one. Feel very 80s.	2
1569	Like Crazy	An odd film. On paper it is should work perfectly. It ticks all the boxes: two young successful (pseudo) artists, deep unjudgemental story-telling, beautiful short focus camerawork. It is almost a formula for indie fans. But the problem is I could never get with these two. Though honest and beautiful, their love was too possessive, too selfish. Perhaps that's why it doesn't work out. But all I was left with is two people who know it isnt going to work out without a sense of the tragedy of it.	1
1570	Starship Troopers	a gore fest that exploited the book in every way possible.	1
1571	Happy Death Day	Basically teen movie but really good with outstanding lead. Could use better bad guy, but still nice one. Feel very 80s.	2

1573	Kick-Ass	*Possible Spoiler Review*  Any film which has a small child say the word cunt before brutally murdering around half a dozen people is instantly a great film in my eyes.	2
1574	Suicide Squad	Couldn't care for a second what's happening in this movie or for any of the characters. Song jingles came and went, one liners was painful to watch. Never understood bad guys snoring and hissing like animals, guess what, this movie has plenty of that too. I guess the best thing about this is first look trailer, hinting dark and gritty story that never was and everything else can be summed up with a quote from Joker blah blah blah blah blah blah.	0
1575	The Fifth Element	No, the Fifth Element is not intended to be taken seriously. Still, this movie is just far more enjoyable than it has any right to be. The action and romance are fun, the characters are unforgettable, the story is entertaining, the music is great, and the visuals are marvelous! The Fifth Element has been in my regular heavy watching rotation since it came out. Give this a watch if you're looking for a witty futuristic cyberpunk action-comedy flick.	2
1576	Begotten	Pretentious boring art film that says nothing	0
1577	District 9	Why don't the aliens talk in English?  And why do humans understand them but respond in English?  I could've missed it, but this really bothers me. Otherwise, this is a great film that explores how humans could possibly react if aliens got stranded in, say, South Africa, where the locals are used to this sort of thing (booooooooo).  The documentary setup goes a long way in convincing me the events are real; the effects and the acting are well-done.  It's a solid entry worth a look.  A	2
1578	Miss Congeniality	A more consistently funnier film than most people give it credit for, with a star turn from actor/producer Sandra Bullock.	2
1579	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	Pasolini accomplished what he was trying to do, which was show a side Nazi fascism in the 1930's and 1940's, and he did it very well. But does that mean I have to like it? No. I was constantly bored, forcing myself to stay awake. It's like softcore with teens and with a lot of adult-to-teen homosexuality. I also don't find eating shit amusing. I wouldn't even call this film disturbing. It's just depraved. The book is much better.	0
1580	Singin' in the Rain	One of the greatest musicals of all time with choreography that's STILL stunning.  Jean Hagen's a goddess as well.	2
1581	The Neon Demon	A beautifully crafted pile of shit.	2
1582	Fight Club	I thought this movie was stupid.  I really didn't see the point.  Of course, I do not have gonads which I believe is vital component for enjoying this film.	0
1583	Never Let Me Go	Nice in concept, could have been executed better. Never really bought into the relationships, never cared about the people. Hospital bedside melodrama isn't very interesting. 	0
1584	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	Pasolini accomplished what he was trying to do, which was show a side Nazi fascism in the 1930's and 1940's, and he did it very well.

1585	The Bourne Legacy	First half of the movie drags like crazy, and there's little payoff as the plot is much simpler even than the prior films' and the characters are cutouts. The second half picks up with some effective action sequences before skidding to a halt with a non-ending. Even if this is just a part one for a new trilogy, Legacy brings nothing new or even all that interesting to the series.	0
1586	First Reformed	this has the usual schrader go-tos but the direction is as strong as the writing for once. he tries out new things with surreal shots and tasteful sound design and it elevates the consistency of his writing a lot. the conflict between old time relijun n good ole christianity as an arm of big business + the republican party is expressed rather beautifully.	2
1587	Hot Fuzz	Sublime! Yes, it just rips of loads of other films, but it doesn't hide that fact. It embraces that fact that it's just a bunch of action setpieces from other films and that is what makes it great. Add to that a ridiculously amazing cast, some great scriptwriting and superb performances and you've got yourself an amazing film. Hot Fuzz ticks all the right boxes, then ticks them all again just for good measure.	2
1588	Jesus Camp	Deeply unnerving. Quote: Your question to me is, do I feel it's right for fundamentalists to indoctrinate their children with their own beliefs, and fundamentally yes I do. ~ Becky Fischer|| As someone who was raised a non-conservative christian, and later made his own decision to give up the belief, I can only hope that some day these children have the opportunity to think for themselves. Regardless of religion, I'm of the opinion that you can't believe unless you doubt first.	1
1589	Cast Away	Do you have a fear of being stranded on an island and want to know what to do to survive? If so, Cast Away is a great film that commentates on how Tom Hanks makes it though the most trying experience as a fed ex enginer. Being isolated on a remote island causes Tom to adopt to life alone. I really enjoyed this film even though i though that some parts of it were far fetched. This film will cause you to never look at a vollyball the same. 	0

1591	Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life	Beautiful and phantasmagoric cinematography, as is expected from the Quays, but it doesn't quite hold together as a feature.  Still, this is probably the best possible adaptation of Walser's wonderful novel.	2
1592	The Godfather	This is supposed to be one of the best movies of our time... and I didn't get it.  I probably owe it another watch.	0
1593	Jupiter Ascending	"Oh my god, that was an abomination
"	0
1594	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	No intelligence.	0
1595	The Happening	A fight broke out in the audience during the opening credits of the film. A guy in the back threw a bag of popcorn onto some people sitting a few rows behind us. They then made their way to the back row to find the tosser. Words were exchanged, one SPIT IN THE OTHER ONES FACE (Who does that?) and they decided to take it outside. We stayed to watch the movie. Mistake. The fight was more of a  happening.	0
1596	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo	Better than Swedish version but still not good enough.	0
1597	The Room	There are only three plausible scores for this film: 0, 100, or perhaps 50 to average the two extremes. Each ought to connote great affection. Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!	0
1598	Saturday Night Fever	this film is about more than disco. Great characters and wonderful writing make it a timeless story that will stand up for decades.	2
1599	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Weird and wild and thematically resonant in a way that makes me care for it more than most of the others in this series. I dug it a lot.	0
1600	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Long, messy, lazy, derivative, shallow and full of injections of totally out of place slapstick humour every few minutes. Massive disappointment. Doesn't build on the framework set up by TFA or move any characters forward in a meaningful or interesting way. 	0
1601	Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me	the more i think about this movie the more i love it	1
1602	300	I was shocked to find out that the working title of this film wasn't 300 Abuses of Slow-Motion Photography. Zack Snyder, who previously directed the horrid 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, is a corporate turd disguising himself as a visionary film-auteur, & his adaptation of Frank Miller's engrossing graphic novel is a tedious and turgid bore. This is the ultimate outing of post-Matrix retardation. Probably the lamest use of green-screen technology to date	0
1603	Wedding Crashers	Wedding Crashers is a cleverly made movie. Although at the surface the movie may seem shallow because of the way Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson crash weddings, it is a very appealing movie because of the twist put on the movie to turn it into a romantic comedy. The movie is a great and provides many laughs and surprise twists. 	2
1604	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A laboured effort. Too similar to A New Hope. Episode I had its issues but at least it tried to be different. It's slick and well produced enough but I can't help feeling this could have been much better.	0
1605	The Revenant	Mance Rayder's performance takes this movie to a whole other level.	1
1606	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Han Solo is killed by his son, Kylo Ren. Luke doesn't say anything and has 30 seconds of screentime. Kylo Ren survives the explosion at the end, leaving it set up for him to be the villain in the next movie... HA! BLOW A DICK U COCKSUCKAS!!	0
1607	Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker	I'm not quite sure how to react to this movie; i can say that it is indeed the worst of the sequel trilogy, but i was expecting much (much) worse. this is actually fine, and my love for everything star wars makes me actually kinda... love it? well, not quite love it (i was actually screaming it was a mess when the movie ended lol, a lot has changed in these last 30 minutes) but it has something, a charm to it. i disagree with many (many) things that happened, i must say, but yeah, i feel weird:)	0

1610	The Crow	when i was in the eight grade i wore a homemade crow outfit to school. it showed everyone the dark tortured soul i was inside. after that jessica aldrich made out with me behind the bleachers but wouldnt go to second base cuz my mascara started to run. well my makeup was a mess so i went to the bathroom to clean up and is aw in me a evil and darness i knew id never outrun. i faced my destiny. i remember stayin home from prom to watch this on vhs on repeat 25 times. wondrous masterwork	0
1611	Mad Max: Fury Road	"Amazingly shot movie... the tag line is misleading :-)
Very good movie, a must watch for action fans."	2
1612	Wreck-It Ralph	Wreck it Ralph is a movie about video games that knows what it's talking about and doesn't once have that feeling of Hey look we are hip with the kids! that many other mainstream stuff about video games (besides most video games) do, with a good story that's well told and a likeable bunch of characters great themes and pacing quite a few emotional moments Wreck it Ralph Is a movie that gamers and non gamers can enjoy.	0
1613	Whiplash	What a fantastic movie! It keeps you engaged from the beginning to the very end. J.K. Simmons nails it. One of the year's best.	2
1614	The Cat in the Hat	I very nearly vomited through this. All those colours were making me nauseous	0
1615	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	I was unaware I could hate a movie more than myself.	0
1616	The Seventh Seal	poetry	2
1617	La Dolce vita	Fellini lived in a completely different world than I do -- I will never have gorgeous women draped on each arm, and a life spent carousing at night while barely working. So I find it challenging to connect with his decadent characters, all of whom seemed bored or depressed with their empty lives. While Fellini brings up interesting ideas (and some beautiful cinematography), at three hours, I'd rather find something else to do.	2
1618	Coco	Coco, with its thematically mature story, breathtaking visual landscape, and highly talented voice cast, is one of the most resounding animated films in years, and will leave all but the most cynical of viewers wholly satisfied.	2
1619	Bohemian Rhapsody	Is it entirely accurate? Probably not. Is it super deep? Not really. But, as someone who hasn't followed Queen's career, I can't really speak to that. For me, judging this purely as a movie that stands on its own, it's very, very good. Rami Malek gives another strong performance & fills Mercury's shoes well. Lucy Boynton is also great as Mary, and the other three band members all have good things to offer. Solid acting, solid music, solid everything. Very worth a watch. 	2
1620	Joker	 The ending (endings?) On a whole fell somehwta flat for me. It's undeniably beautiful to look at. What it lacks in subtly it makes up for in style. Jokers standup was a G rated Neil Hamburger. Some say this is a sign of maturity in the superhero genre but have we already forgotten Logan?	0
1621	Breaking Bad	Breaking Bad is the pinnacle of TV drama. While the focus is certainly the transformation of Walter White, the richness of the periphery truly elevates his story. I don't think I've ever seen a show that so successfully builds suspense over multiple seasons toward a thunderous finish.	2
1622	Gods of Egypt	My favourite moment was when the character Zaya died and my girlfriend said Zaya-nara!. The film itself was not so entertaining however.	0
1623	The Adventures of Tintin	May be there was a little unnecessarily redundant action but applauds to Spielberg and his fellows for preserving and reflecting Herge's spirit to the motion picture almost flawlessly with this postmodern Tintin.	2
1624	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2	First of all, I do admit that the last scene was pretty cheesy. But other than that I enjoyed every minute of it since it kept me on the edge of my seat during the whole movie. I was pretty shocked, nay, devastated about Prim's death (I didn't read the books, shame on me!), though. How ironic is that?! But all in all I loved the movie as part of a whole epic film series about a girl that starts off as a brave sister and ends up as the leader of a crucial revolution for humanity.	2
1625	Mary and the Witch's Flower	Mary and the Witch's Flower honors its creator's Studio Ghibli roots with a gentle, beautifully animated story whose simplicity is rounded out by its entrancing visuals.	2
1626	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas	Fantastic, psychedelic drug odyssey. 	2
1627	Ocean's 8	Better than 12 but not good as 13. I don’t need to mention about dlfference between 11 and this. It’s fun for sure but has a little bit silly storyline and execution. When you look at the cast you expect something smarter than this.	2
1628	The Conversation	I think, It is a valley between Godfather Mountains. The man's dilemma between religion and his professional life is performed by Gene Hackman successfully but slow progress make the film so boring.	2
1629	Watchmen	"We are all puppets, Laurie. I'm just the puppet who can see the strings.
Watchmen is a hugely underrated film. It is a dark, disturbing masterpiece. It is visually stimulating, while also strong intellectually. The acting was solid all around. I was especially impressed by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. I appreciate how the film is mostly seem from his perspective. Most of the characters are well developed and quite complex as they are not good nor bad but both."	2
1630	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas	Fantastic, psychedelic drug odyssey. 	2
1631	Ex Machina	I can't wait for AI to own all our dicks	1
1632	Big Hero 6	As with many Disney movies it tackles the adult issue in a kid-friendly wrapper. On one hand, it deals with grief, loss, revenge. On the other hand ERMEGERD ROBOTS AND NANOBOTS AND SUPERHEROS YEAH	2
1633	Her	The Guy who wrote it is probably a genius. Yep, genious. Loved it.	2
1634	Guardians of the Galaxy	Fed up with gritty heroes, portentous legacies, and joyless treks into darkness, this movie couldn't be more refreshing. Guardians ditches Hollywood bleakness and returns to classic swashbuckling sci-fi. With constant references to genre and commentary that carefully breaks the fourth wall, James Gunn maintains his film's integrity without pandering to middle school angst.	2
1635	The Handmaid's Tale	This undisguised piece of contemporary agitprop will inculcate gullible viewers with the idea that religious people in the USA are natural fascists eager to exterminate gays, install a militaristic state, put lower classes and women into serfdom, you name it.	2
1636	Gerald's Game	That was not what I was expecting from the director of «Oculus» and «Absentia» but we must consider this as a commissioned work and not as an original film.	0
1637	The Thing	One of my favorites by John Carpenter and Kurt Russel! Cool setting and deep atmosphere	1
1638	Inception	I'm having a hard time thinking of anything negative to say. This movie was a masterpiece.	0
1639	BoJack Horseman	The most impressive thing about this show is its control of the emotion it wants to give. It's hilarious if it wants to be, awe-striking if it wants to be, complicated if it wants to be. And most importantly, it is fully capable of dragging your soul through the dirt the way you never thought possible, time and time again, whenever the writers so choose.	2
1640	The Matrix	Gorgeous movie and should have been a stand alone. The sequels slightly ruined the whole thing, but this one is great. Fantastic CGI, great story, and even Keanu Reeves can't ruin it.	2
1641	Drive	Ryan Gosling stares: The Movie	1
1642	Rocky III	The original might be a better movie, but Rocky III is a lot more fun. Chalk it up to all the fool-pitying.	2
1643	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Honestly worth the price of admission so that Oscar Isaac could add fuel to the nerdy flames of desire that Harrison Ford first stoked in my youth.	2
1644	The Shaggy Dog	Tim Allen is Disney's bitch.	1
1645	Bone Tomahawk	The pacing in the movie is very interesting, and I'm not sure why. The characters are excellent (although Chicory's speech is odd). I was interested the whole way through, and the I loved that the characters had experience (not just the usual horse-riding and gunplay); hence some nice details (tripwire, dialogue, signals, markers, etc). My only serious complaint is with the troglodytes and their features (bizarre to say the least). On a side note, Sheriff Hunt is as Lawful Good as it gets.	2
1646	Snowpiercer	good bad dream	1
1647	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	I loved this film when it came out.  Now that Tom Cruise is a psycho, my opinion's gone from love to like it a lot	1
1648	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	Spider-Verse fucking murdered it. This has game changing potential for the medium. See it yesterday.	2
1649	Survivor	Pierce Brosnan's performance shines a lonely yet still tiny light on this underwhelming succession of plot holes. -- Poor directing, editing, book and general acting with no tension at all. 	1
1650	Snowpiercer	good bad dream	1
1651	Taken	The epitome of bad ass.	0
1652	The Room	The perfect shitfest. It's simultaneously the best and the worst movie ever made.	1
1653	Snowpiercer	Pretty conflicted on this. While it was enjoyable and never boring, it was also kinda clunky and disjointed. The dialogue was pretty weird at times and I didn't feel emotionally engaged through most of it.	0
1654	Resident Evil: Apocalypse	Everything you'd expect in a Paul Anderson movie. Backflips, explosions, giant disposable monster things and MAD GUNZ. Retarded, but watchable.	1
1655	Crash	Brokeback was fucking robbed. [2]	1
1656	The Thing	Fantastic horror film that actually succeeds on using special effects to build a scary tension. Good character acting as well. I've seen this a dozen times at least....	2
1657	The Matrix	Has not aged well at all, many scenes feel almost insultingly pretentious and a lot of the action scenes no longer have the feeling they once had (though the movie shouldn't be faulted for that, pop culture should).  It feels like it got too popular too fast and couldn't hold onto long-term stability.	0
1658	Her	Short of perfect. Can't put my finger on it. Great social commentary on futurist topics like the AI Singularity. Perhaps I'd like to know more about where these OS' went. Still, give away too much and you can fuck up a film pretty quickly. Some things are better off left unsaid.	1
1659	The Mummy	Waaaay better than the new stuff :)	2
1660	The Thing	Fantastic horror film that actually succeeds on using special effects to build a scary tension. Good character acting as well. I've seen this a dozen times at least....	2
1661	The Matrix	Has not aged well at all, many scenes feel almost insultingly pretentious and a lot of the action scenes no longer have the feeling they once had (though the movie shouldn't be faulted for that, pop culture should).  It feels like it got too popular too fast and couldn't hold onto long-term stability.	0
1662	Her	Short of perfect. Can't put my finger on it. Great social commentary on futurist topics like the AI Singularity. Perhaps I'd like to know more about where these OS' went. Still, give away too much and you can fuck up a film pretty quickly. Some things are better off left unsaid.	1
1663	Napoleon Dynamite	Honestly, who watched this movie and didn't relate to have the things they did (to a lesser extent, hopefully)? Such a funny movie. What, you don't like it? GOD, IDIOT!!	1
1664	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Perhaps my favorite movie of 2005, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was unfortunately plagued by horrible publishing, advertising, and lack of theatres on its opening day so it completely tanked, despite its small 15 million$ budget. Shane Black's exceptional directing skills and script absolutely shine here. Robert Downey Jr. delivers his best performance of all time and along with Shane Black's script make even scenes that would normally be distrubing very paletteble. A great throwback to the 80s action 	2
1665	The Burrowers	Competent film, disappointing creatures, good cinematography, overall, not so good night-time cinematography.	2
1666	Invasion of the Body Snatchers	A deeply disturbing, dark portrayel of the inevitable. The smothering atmosphere that drapes itself over the entire movie is what makes it outstanding. The direction is outstanding in its creation of that paranoid atmosphere. The acting is outstanding in parts, and mediocre in others. The two leads never falter though. It should be more widely praised than it currently is.	1
1667	Kill List	A bit of an odd one as it transcends genres which can leave you baffled after everything's said and done. Looking back however, there are hints of continuity and a foreshadowing of things to come. With that in mind we are left with something which is disturbing yet also intriguing and polarizing. As far as nit picking goes I did find the dialogue rather unintelligible at times which is a bit of a bother. Other than that I'd recommend this to those in need of something 'different'. Brrr.	2
1668	Battleship Potemkin	There is one phenomenal scene which is the massacre on the steps.  That one scene makes the film worth viewing for students of film and film history; however, other than that one scene, which has been imitated in hundreds of other films, this film is unimpressive to modern eyes.	2
1669	Post Grad	i was pretty drunk when i watched some of it but it seemed really shitty plus saracen is in this and he's a p. good quarterback but so god damn useless at life	0
1670	Die Hard	Best action movie - Yipee Kiya Mother$#@*&%	2
1671	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug	I love JRR Tolkien. BUT this is a letdown. Unlike the original LOTR trilogy, the new movies seem to rely heavily on CGI tricks. When I watch the original movies I always say the trolls look silly now, but the rest is great. I believe this movie will grow old rather quickly. The main problem is its plot. There are too many scenes that seem recycled rather than an homage to its predecessors. The movie is dark rather than a fairy tale original. The heroes are walking cliches...	1
1672	Dolls	I have a soft spot for this, despite the fact that it never quite lived up to it's poster.	1
1673	Good Morning	Watching this my mother thought I had one of those 3D TVs: to Ozu's credit every shot is beautifully crafted with depth cues and nuance that's missing in a lot of movies today. The story is light-hearted but not to be brushed off in favor of heavy stuff like Tokyo Story or the other depictions of family dissolution. The script is playful and elegant in its compactness. Like Mozart you lose yourself in sheer joy in the playful architecture. And there are fart jokes.	1
1674	Battleship Potemkin	There is one phenomenal scene which is the massacre on the steps.  That one scene makes the film worth viewing for students of film and film history; however, other than that one scene, which has been imitated in hundreds of other films, this film is unimpressive to modern eyes.	2
1675	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo	I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Good little mystery. Nice unique characters that are fleshed out. Brilliant and flawed. Inventive way Lisbeth solves her problems.	2
1676	Post Grad	i was pretty drunk when i watched some of it but it seemed really shitty plus saracen is in this and he's a p. good quarterback but so god damn useless at life	0
1677	Taken	Her friend died, no-one cares. 	0
1678	Ghost World	It was a nice take on the comic. Plus, Scarlet and Thora are totally hot.	2
1679	Let the Right One In	My kind of love story.	1
1680	Naked	Johnny has all the charm of a philosophy student enamored with nihilism. Using his existential angst and accrued stank from homelessness, he wracks up a queue of self-loathing women begging to be sexually assaulted. While not committing rape, our protagonist wins over drunk and bored strangers by rambling on about the end of mankind. Edgy! Naked is a sociopathic romp through an alternate universe where every human being has been replaced by a pathetic pile of slag.	1
1681	2001: A Space Odyssey	A monolith, a leap of mankind, animal to human; a leap of technology, circuits to awareness; the creation questions the creator; from being to becoming to being, a man now a god	2
1682	Winter's Bone	Granik's finely-tuned evocation of the poverty stricken Ozark community and her windswept cinematography serves as an excellent backdrop to a grimy and simple pulp thriller that never really transcends said pulp roots. Hawkes is spectacular, stealing scene after scene from Lawrence's taciturn but unremarkable lead performance, and everything about the film carries an air of authenticity that's hard to shake, from the dialogue to the cold hues of the backwoods.	0
1683	Titanic	Despite the cost to make it and the awards it won, it's not even the best Titanic movie.	1
1684	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey	Woody Allen once said a relationship is like a shark, it has to constantly move forward or it dies. The same may be said about a film. Unless either the story or characters are moving forward, the film dies. And unfortunately, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a dead shark, or at the very least a dying one.	0
1685	Twin Peaks	Humanity's best achievement.	2
1686	The Master	The least entertaining PTA film I've seen (haven't seen Hard Eight). Masterfully (lol) crafted, but it just drags at parts. Hoffman and Phoenix are unbelievable, but it's not enough to make me love the film.	1
1687	Black Hawk Down	Probably my all time favorite war film...  For those who might think BHD went hollywood with the graphic display of fighting, explosions, etc., one would only need to research the actual accounts from those who survived this mission.  Great film....	2
1688	Forrest Gump	The movie that taught us that the ideal US citizen is an asexual developmentally-challenged man-child who does anything an authority figure tells him. Oh, and if you're a liberal, you will die of AIDS.	1
1689	Her	The best movie i have seen in 2013. I want a SAMANTHA right now	2
1690	Her	The best movie i have seen in 2013. I want a SAMANTHA right now	2
1691	Ponyo	I don't know why but this is the first Miyazaki film I really enjoyed. It's incredibly sweet & cute & despite not being a fan of anime, I vastly preferred it over the mainstream western animations of the last decade. But I wasn't a fan of the Goddess of Mercy. Besides looking like she climbed out of Sailor Moon, her appearance negated the humanness of the other characters, erasing their struggles and doubts in a rather uncinematic fashion. Stole the show unfairly.	0
1692	Big Fish	This did not warm my heart, it made my brain melt with its tedious nonsense. 	1
1693	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Best Star Wars film since Empire. More depth than Force Awakens, helps bridge the gap between the first two trilogies.	2
1694	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	there are quite so much original scenes and it makes me watching so exicting. oscar should go to this movie. not the fuckin shape of stg... ( i dont watch it btw)	1
1695	Avengers: Endgame	The finale to end all finales. Finally a franchise that manages to stick the landing.   Watched: 24-Apr-19, 28-Apr-19	1
1696	The Good Dinosaur	I enjoyed the backdrop of the movie the most. Beautiful landscapes and majestic scenery. The plot, however, was what was most disappointing - for an adult. The story was simple and easy to follow, and it makes sense for a children's movie.	2
1697	Her	100. Why not? One of the best films of 2013, encapsulating contemporary problems and problems that humans have faced since conciousness: the prevailing presence of technology and the search for love. Brilliantly executed - look out for the very natural lighting accompanied with the pastel palette juxtaposed with the futuristic presence of the film.	2
1698	The Accountant	This had potential early on. There was a cool mystery about the main character. That devolved into a convoluted storyline where the hero is an autistic, martial arts master/stone cold killer/accountant who has a conscience, but basically no emotion. And his brother is the assassin villain. The acting and story is too comical to be taken at all seriously when you think about it. Affleck is basically a 'special needs' reincarnation of Steven Seagal in a cheesy 80's action film.	2
1699	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Great film by J.J. who delivers a film filled fun and lovable characters. Despite all the old characters, the movie does feel really fresh, and with the technological improvements over the years, and the improvements in the acting department makes for a gripping watch. Really enjoyed the references to the older movies too. I think the movie is substantially based on the older movies, but it did not feel like a rehash to me.	1
1700	Toy Story 4	Completely unnecessary and yet still fantastic. I was really skeptical when this film was announced and subsequently the release dates were pushed back. Ultimately, it didn't matter. The story was great, the animation was great. Think of it as more the first entry of a new series with some old characters, rather than the fourth entry of an existing series.	0
1701	Shaun of the Dead	Zom Rom Com? Such a great movie, hilarious from start to finish with some awesome gore. 	2
1702	Gummo	Harmony Korine's first masterpiece.	2
1703	The Boy	I was so enchanted by this movie - I loved the careful cinematography, the use of light and silhouettes, the subtlety and slowly building tension: the pacing and weaving of the story was impeccable, and I felt this was a doll movie unlike other doll movies.  That is, until it was haphazardly and messily revealed that it wasn't a doll movie at all, but a rather pathetic imitation of a stranger in the walls story. Extremely disappointing ending: would not recommend.	2
1704	Joker	You can appreciate some elements of this movie (cinematography, score, performance), but it just doesn't add up to a cohesive or satisfying movie experience as a whole. Significantly worse than its inspirations and just downright boring at times.	0
1705	The Salesman	What I admire about this film is 1) Farhadi maintains his exceptional and engaging style of storytelling and 2) like in About Elly and A Separation, he challenges both our collective values and inner judgements. What I DON'T appreciate as a viewer is an extra touch of manipulation and melodrama when he's doing so in the climax of this film (unlike in A.E. & A Sep). The parallel between Emad and Willy or rather the two couples also seems to be a bit of a stretch, just not compelling enough.	0
1706	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	You'll find yourselves torn between moments of total confusion and moments of utter joy and memories of wanting to do everything to win the one you love.A Charming movie.	2
1707	Watchmen	Watchmen is famous from the hallowed graphic novel by More and Gibbons. Before watching this film, no fan of Watchmen believes that it could live up to that kind of reputation. This film comes amazingly close. Zack Snyder pulls off his best work in a compelling take on Watchmen with an ending that is arguably more suited than even the books. This dark tale pays homage to the pages on which it was born and goes beyond what is expected.	2
1708	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	It's like a beer commercial complete with a babe, cars that shine and no brains whatsoever. I have rarely felt more queasy than when I saw soldiers and robots share brotherhood. It is nonsensical and such an ode to war and the army that it makes me want to vomit.	0
1709	Annie Hall	This is probably Woody Allen's alltime best movie. Personally, my favourite scene is the subtitled scene where they reveal the true nature of the conversation between Woody and Diane Keaton. Brilliant! 'We need the eggs', and this is one of the tastiest I have ever tried!	0
1710	Transformers: Age of Extinction	"Pro: No Shia LaBeouf.

Con: Everything else.

You know what you're getting, a clusterf*ck of stupidity and explosions assaulting the senses."	0
1711	Suicide Squad	I dont know comics, so i liked it as superheroes action flick.	2
1712	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood	In what will probably be the most divisive film of the year, Tarantino delivers his signature style of filmmaking, but he tries balancing too many elements at once. It lacks identity. The script wanders all over the place until it reaches an inevitable Tarantino bloody climax. It's pacing has all the nuance of a parabola, starting strong in the first act, lulling the audience to sleep in the second, and then suddenly spiking back up again at the end. Oh, and we get it Quentin, you like feet. 	0
1713	Her	the main philosophical idea is so deep, on the other hand i could design it more tragic. modernity/postmodernity/ontology concept rethinking	2
1714	Ghostbusters	Took me entirely too long to see this, but it was great. Pretty much anything Bill Murray says is classic.	0
1715	Winter's Bone	It looks great, is gritty, and there are some good performances, but it's just too slow moving. Shouting at plot holes might make this a fun time.	0
1716	Gladiator	Action throughout.  Felt compelled to route on Crowe.	1
1717	The Others	a rather standart spook stuff with a GREAT twist in the end	2
1718	The Beyond	Some good scenes, especially gore ones. Very poor acting. Remember - Watch your eyeballs and shoot zombies always in the head!	2
1719	The Martian	"Loved the movie, and while I can't comment on most of the scientific stuff there was one thing bothering me. The God-Tarp. Won't spoil it, but you will see it. The God-Tarp is allmighty. 

The ironic/sarcastic demeanor of the main character is refrenshin compared to stone-faced, serious types."	2
1720	The Martian	"Loved the movie, and while I can't comment on most of the scientific stuff there was one thing bothering me. The God-Tarp. Won't spoil it, but you will see it. The God-Tarp is allmighty. 

The ironic/sarcastic demeanor of the main character is refrenshin compared to stone-faced, serious types."	2
1721	Isle of Dogs	A neat experiment from Wes Anderson. Isle of Dogs is a wholesome adventure with a dark backdrop. It is not overly quirky, so I enjoyed it a fair bit. Tilda Swinton plays a pug.	2
1722	Falling Down	All I can really say is it's in my top 10 of all time	2
1723	Drive	Great soundtrack	2
1724	City of God	It's no surprise i think good of this movie. It has a story and characters that capture you and presents a breathing world. The storytelling is one level above everything i''ve seen before.  	0
1725	First Blood	Really good show of ptsd. Great concept and cinematography but it could have been like 15 minutes long	1
1726	Pan's Labyrinth	Del Toro is a god.	1
1727	Pan's Labyrinth	Superb. Full of aesthetic wonder and visual delight. Full of symbolism. Positions 2 stories next to each other and intertwines them. One about the stark and violent Spanish civil war. The other about a young girl and the childlike, fairytale world she enters. How can stories of such vivid contradiction work together in one film, you may ask. Watch it and find out. Mindblowing.	2
1728	Irreversible	Fantastic, really twists with your mind.	2
1729	Catwoman	It doesn't get worse.  Movies that were MST3K'ed were better than this.	0
1730	Catwoman	It doesn't get worse.  Movies that were MST3K'ed were better than this.	0
1731	The Exterminating Angel	It's two hours of surrealist No-Exit-esque heaven.	2
1732	Exit Through the Gift Shop	The first forty minutes of Exit... are SO energetic and exciting, in a way it's almost a shame the film loses that as the focus shifts to the Mr. Brainwash character. Taking it at face value, Exit... reamins a contentious look at the paradox of street/modern art. 	1
1733	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	It just hooks fans to the new generation of characters. No new story.	1
1734	The Lobster	Filmen förutsätter att åskådaren accepterar några ganska absurda premisser. Gör man det har man sedan en ganska rolig stund framför bioduken. Farrell är utmärkt i huvudrollen och visar sig kunna långt mer än jag trodde på förhand. Men har filmen nåt att säga? Den vill nog få oss att fundera kring samhällets normer för vad som är match mellan en man och en kvinna och varför vi (I allmänhet) eftersträvar att leva parliv. Men nåt eget bud är det tveksamt om den ger.	0
1735	You Were Never Really Here	A bulked-up Phoenix dominates the frame in almost every scene, stalking around Jonny Greenwood's understated score for the duration.    The film's treatment of violence is interesting - time and time again it cuts away at the last second or has the act happen just out of shot, but turns the tables by forcing you to stare at the results for seconds at a time.	0
1736	Never Let Me Go	Beautifully directed, phenomenally well-acted love story set in an alternate past. This is a subversion on the typical Hollywood fare and actually invites audience interpretation and reflection. Rather than belittling the characters for their atypical response to their purpose, I condemned a world that would marginalise and trample on the underclass so carelessly, at once reminded of the brevity and preciousness of life. Remarkably restrained and poetic in its elegance 	2
1737	Erin Brockovich	Julia Roberts tits vs. evil corporations 	1
1738	Pulp Fiction	Tarantino's best film, wonderfully put together.	2
1739	Van Helsing	The only time I've ever got to see an entire theatre's audience rebel against what was being shoveled down their throats. It was glorious.	1
1740	The Incredibles	For a children's film this movie is amazing.  It is better than most adult films.  The characters are developed and the story solid.  	2
1741	Jaws	Scared the shit out of me.	1
1742	Get Out	Much better than the 2004 remake of The Stepford Wives.	1
1743	Alien: Resurrection	The alienated Alien film. Though often the subject of bad reviews, Alien Resurrection is an incredibly entertaining film. Though the writting certainly is not the strongest, the characters are very likeable, the action is exciting, and it stands out a bizarre departure from the rest of the series. 	1
1744	Hereditary	Definitely one of the better horror movies I have watched. Nice build-up of tension, fitting score. The acting was good, especially the mother. Kudos for not relying on jump-scares. I felt the ending really deflated the whole thing though, but then again, most horror movie endings do that for me. 	2
1745	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	Easily the best of The Terminator franchise, and a truly epic action movie. James Cameron's finest work in my opinion, I only wish they had stopped with this one.	0
1746	The Substance: Albert Hofmann's LSD	What is the nature of the effects produced by psychedelics? Are they processes that go on in your head all the time, like dreams, that you just aren't aware of without a little help, or are they produced by the substances, or are they really a glimpse to a brand new layer of reality? We still don't know the answer to that, since research has been forbidden for decades. It's one of the greatest crimes against humanity that people aren't allowed to search for the answer by themselves.	2
1747	The Hours	Depressed women apparently with no reason why.	0
1748	Her	Flimsy as a science fiction story (too many inconsistencies, too little exploration of the broader consequences of AIs); trite as a love story - given that Her speaks and acts exactly as a human being would. So what is exactly the point of this movie? And what happened to the world's natural intelligence since Kubrick's 2001?	0
1749	Juno	Honest to blog I wanted to like this movie, but now I cringe at every ad for it.  Every character is written to be 22 years old.  You know what's cool?  Guitars.  And horror movies.  And being an expert on music from before you were born.	2
1750	Night at the Museum	Ricky Gervais was the best thing about this film	2
1751	Oblivion	mid life crisis the movie, almost does something cool with it retreating back into the blandest safest ending possible. even on its own terms (creeping dissatisfaction with yr beautiful wife and house not ameliorated by yr cool job + motorcycle + flying car, disquieting sensation that yr lifestyle is destroying the planet, yr inevitable death) it taps out without dealing with any of it. for a film titled 'oblivion' that's p disappointing.	0
1752	Dumb and Dumber	One of the funniest movies of all time!  Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels are brilliant in this comedy classic.	2
1753	Ocean's 8	Generally good performances (could have done without James Corden) and entertaining scene by scene, but overall a weak plot with boring direction.	2
1754	The Notebook	Um, I'm a dude and I liked it......  I have to go punch kittens in the face now.	2
1755	The Cabin in the Woods	As a critique of modern horror it is outdated and uninformed. As a horror film it falls into the tropes it attempts to lampoon. Cabin in the Woods attempts to be both horror and comedy yet fails at both. Just watch the Halloween House episode of Buffy and save yourself the time and money.	0
1756	Her	Flimsy as a science fiction story (too many inconsistencies, too little exploration of the broader consequences of AIs); trite as a love story - given that Her speaks and acts exactly as a human being would. So what is exactly the point of this movie? And what happened to the world's natural intelligence since Kubrick's 2001?	0
1757	The Matrix	Beautifully written, intellectually engaging, aesthetically stunning. I can watch it over & over again and see more and more in the film.	2
1758	Mad Max: Fury Road	Thanks, George Miller. I was so afraid for this film but you executed it justly for a 21st century audience. 	2
1759	Joker	It's cool. Pretty cool. Not that the outcast gone mad is a particularly new trope, but Phillips does have a talent for subtlety and playing with the espectations of the public even more than the title character (which is brilliantly interpreted by Phoenix, btw). Such a pity that all the subtlety is thrown out of the window with an almost literal we live in a society monologue near the end. Luckly, it wasn't enough to ruin the rest of the experience.	0
1760	The Matrix	Beautifully written, intellectually engaging, aesthetically stunning. I can watch it over & over again and see more and more in the film.	2
1761	Mad Max: Fury Road	Thanks, George Miller. I was so afraid for this film but you executed it justly for a 21st century audience. 	2
1762	Joker	It's cool. Pretty cool. Not that the outcast gone mad is a particularly new trope, but Phillips does have a talent for subtlety and playing with the espectations of the public even more than the title character (which is brilliantly interpreted by Phoenix, btw). Such a pity that all the subtlety is thrown out of the window with an almost literal we live in a society monologue near the end. Luckly, it wasn't enough to ruin the rest of the experience.	0
1763	Predator	Interesting Vietnam War metaphor, with the Predator alien as a twisted vision of the Vietcong. A fun Ahnuld movie with a surprising amount of the cast going on to dabble in politics. Go figure. 	2
1764	Troy	This is alternate universe Troy, or maybe Bizarro World Troy, where Agamemnon gets killed so never returns home. Thus, there is no Orestes nor, ultimately, Hamlet. Nor do Priam and Helen retire to Egypt, nor is there genuine Homeric glory nor heroic pathos (though the film tries to fake both). Sing, Goddess, the ineptitude of Hollywood.	0
1765	Whiplash	Another example of where I must have watched a completely different film from everyone else. The character development isn't just lacking, it's practically non-existent; the great cinematography is undoubtedly impressive but only comprises of comedy drummers' faces. The message of the film is dishonest and trite. Nothing good I can say about this.	1
1766	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	"Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer make a great team.

Enjoyable as detective crime-y suspense or as very smart comedy."	2
1767	Shutter Island	Shutter Island is an amazingly ambitious journey through the mind. Starting from the very beginning, you are instilled with a sense of dread and eventually hopelessness that mirrors that of the main character. As he struggles to uncover all the mysteries of Ashecliffe, you begin to doubt whether or not he'll ever find what he's looking for and just how much of this is in the hero's mind. Never boring, Shutter Island is an unpredictable mystery with brilliant performances through out. 	2
1768	The Outsiders	I appreciated the loyalty to the book and the cast of 80s hunks all old enough to be my father.	2
1769	Her	"What a waste of time this movie is. Phoenix tries really hard to save it but there is no saving grace for this, corny, cheap, boring, mass-appealing piece of trash. An insult to our intelligence.

If this is supposed to be thought-provoking or even ground-breaking, then I am Batman."	0
1770	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	It has it's problems, by nature of trying to mirror A New Hope in order to restart the Star Wars experience, but the new characters are wonderful. Daisy Ripley is particularly strong as Rey, and I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up as a watershed moment for actually strong female characters in big Hollywood blockbusters.	2
1771	The Cabin in the Woods	starts with great idea but ending is not satisfy..	1
1772	Inception	I'm sure it's brilliant, but I'm not going to watch it 100x to find out.	2
1773	The Hangover	With a clever script and hilarious interplay among the cast, The Hangover nails just the right tone of raunchy humor, and the non-stop laughs overshadow any flaw.	2
1774	Predators	A curiously joyless movie. While I can't very well say it isn't better than the AvPs, those at least prompted some sort of emotional reaction from me (guess which), whereas Predators left me cold. It is at the very least competently directed and acted. Unfortunately, none of the characters, including the titular monsters, held much interest. I think it may be time to accept that the Predator concept just didn't have enough to it to warrant more than the original film.	0
1775	Serenity	The way Sci fi movies should be. Incredibly well written, great performances from a cast who are used to each other and play off each other well. Not to mention hilariously clever writing. Joss really is great at what he does... among my favourite films of last year.	2
1776	Forbidden Games	Great opening and closing scene. Very natural acting from the two children - its almost like real life. However, the rest of the story is a little lacklustre and didn't really impacted me the way it did for others. It also didn't really explore some of the smaller concerns it has presented. 	2
1777	Shutter Island	Shutter Island is an amazingly ambitious journey through the mind. Starting from the very beginning, you are instilled with a sense of dread and eventually hopelessness that mirrors that of the main character. As he struggles to uncover all the mysteries of Ashecliffe, you begin to doubt whether or not he'll ever find what he's looking for and just how much of this is in the hero's mind. Never boring, Shutter Island is an unpredictable mystery with brilliant performances through out. 	2
1778	Dark Shadows	This is an interesting idea that goes wrong in a lot of ways. The dramatic thread of the movie is abandoned and picked up at random intervals, far too many of the jokes fall flat, and it just isn't terribly entertaining. I don't mind mixing tones and ideas, but this movie just throws in complete schlock gags whenever it feels like it and then tries to follow a serious dramatic thread with Barnabus Collins (Depp) lamenting his existence as a vampire. There's some charm, but it's just a mess. 	0
1779	Gravity	A big dumb movie that is very nice to look at. The soundtrack can rot in hell, though.	0
1780	Batman	It's always so hard for me to rate campy films such as this. I would be lying if I said this film is not enjoyable, but I would also be lying if I said that it is a good film. It is one of those many films that is just bad enough to be good (at the risk of being hated by every self respecting Batman fan, I also must admit that the kitschy horrid-ness of Schumacher's Batman and Robin falls in the same category of bad-goodness.)	1
1781	Absolutely Anything	eng; [absolutely anything]; eine gruppe von aliens entscheidet darüber ob die erde zerstört oder in ihre allianz aufgenommen werden soll - doch um das zu entscheiden, bekommt ein mensch testweise die fähigkeit alles zu tun was er will.;	1
1782	Us	B+	1
1783	Inception	very nice!	2
1784	Wind River	Really good. Not entirely sure what the plan was for some of the individuals in the last act but didn't detract too much from the film. 	1
1785	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	One of the biggest disappointments ever. A total rip off of episode 4, not a single original element. The characters are awful, Rey especially, but Finn's awful quip's gives Rey's awfulness a run for its money. Their villain is ruined in the end. Prequels were better.	0
1786	Ex Machina	THRILLING! Good cinema.	2
1787	The Florida Project	An amazing look at poverty from a child's perspective.  You see and know exactly what is happening in the adult world but that isn't what really takes center stage, which is what makes this movie so unique.  Every scene is a treat.  Left me with many different angles to contemplate.	2
1788	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1	This is a well-made piece of entertainment that asks the audience to slow down and examine the themes that have been hanging in the background of the series.	2
1789	The Last Picture Show	Sam the Lion: Ain't that ridiculous?... Naw, it ain't really. 'Cause being crazy about a woman like her is always the right thing to do. Being an old decrepit bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous. Gettin' old.	0
1790	Contact	Just re-watched this for the first time since, apparently, 1997. It bowled me over back then; my eyes were a bit more open this time. But it stands the test of 17 years.  It's a fantastic story with great special effects (especially given it was made in '97).  The low points are few and are no more than minor distractions; e.g., the acting in the mishap at the first IMC, and the science-religion comparison (i.e., I know what I know though I can't prove it) in the court hearing at the end.	0
1791	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	LOVED this movie.  	2
1792	Roma	i took many notes on its wonderful cinematographic techniques, but this film suffers from the main problem of many autobiographical narratives, namely, including a great amount of tiny details, yet consequently leading to a sloppy and facile story structure.	1
1793	Avengers: Endgame	How do you mess up a time travel heist? This should have been an exciting film, but it gets bogged down in dull concepts and even worse action direction. Marvel should really hire people who can do action because the action in their films is the most boring part of any of their films. There is a nice emotional core to the film, but the action scenes are way over edited and nonsensical. 	0
1794	Coco	This movie was great. 	2
1795	Jonah Hex	 Action western, based on a DC Comics character, about a bounty hunter who is asked by the U.S. military to stop a terrorist in order to eradicate the outstanding warrants on his own head. a confusing and poorly shot adaptation of a minor comic-book story that feels days longer than its 80-minute running time.... a jumble of supernatural elements, a love story and selective bits of the comic book. None of the parts are developed enough to be interesting.	0
1796	Avengers: Endgame	Why do I agree to watch these?	0
1797	Lawrence of Arabia	One of the greatest stories ever told, and told beautifully.	2
1798	Seven Samurai	The ultimate Western is an Eastern. The storytelling is fantastic. The characters are beautiful portrayed with many details and the actors apparently had much fun playing their roles. Lean back and enjoy every minute of battle between good and bad.	2
1799	District 9	Neil Blomkamp really outdoes himself here, and Sharlto Copely's performance is second to none. Excellent sci-fi-action-drama set to recognizable and thought provoking themes. Superbly executed. One of my favorites.	2
1800	The Discovery	A great premise that could have (and does in some instances) given way to a contemplative and beautiful film about the meaning of life, what drives us as a species to fight and continue living everyday. The Discovery ends up being a slightly more scientific version of The butterfly effect, with very little of its most interesting themes explored beyond them serving as exposition. Truly a shame.	1
1801	Big	sweet and very funny. 	2
1802	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Brings back all that is good about Star wars and mixes them into an enjoyable story. It sticks to the formula, but it's a good formula. 	2
1803	Dead End	Horror, thriller i szczypta czarnej komedii. Wynik jest lepszy niz przypuszczalem, to naprawde bardzo dobry film, zarowno od strony ciekawego scenariusza, az po dobre dialogi i dosc realistyczne zachowania postaci (a przynajmniej nie ma takich bezsensow jak w wielu innych horrorkach). Bawilem sie znakomicie, ten film i trzyma w napieciu i chwilami wywoluje usmieszek na twarzy. Polecam.	1
1804	Searching	We were talking about how weird it is, how much of our lives we live on our devices, and yet how rarely and terribly movies and TV shows convey their ubiquity. This movie is different. Highly recommended. 	0
1805	Terminator: Dark Fate	Linda Hamilton'un devam filminde oynadığı yokedici filmi. Yeni karakterlerin olduğu film, aksiyon sahneleriyle de izlettiriyor. Fakat kendini tekrarlayan bir yapım olmuş. Dani kızımızı kurtarmaya çalışan, iki kadın kurtarıcımız, erkek yokediciyle savaşmak zorundadır. Filmin sonunda, Terminator 2 ile aynı bitiyor. Terminator nostaljisi. Metal Motherfucker. 	0
1806	Ex Machina	"For most of the film it feels like we're getting ready to delve into some real substance, and unfortunately that goes nowhere. The setpieces and acting are all fine, maybe good, but again, it feels like there's nothing novel here.

It might be arrogant to say it, but Ex Machina seems like it should only be entertaining to those that have never considered or thought about it's ideas. To someone that has, it's somewhat old hat.

I can appreciate the ending, and wish they'd expanded on it."	2
1807	Shaun of the Dead	Charismatic cast, great humor, a dash of foreshadowing...this movie had it all!	2
1808	Her	This is a very sweet and sad romantic drama, that shows how we are developing with social media perfectly.   	2
1809	Mandy	An intriguing film that fell flat for me as it dragged on. Nic Cage provided some shining moments but in the end it didn't live up to my expectations. Great soundtrack though.	2
1810	The Notebook	Ashamed to admit... 	1
1811	Unbreakable	A nearly perfect movie by M. Night and quite possibly one of his most underrated.  Samuel is a master actor forget a-list or b-list he is on another plane of acting and can't be touched.  Bruce Willis always makes you feel like you are right there in the movie.  He gives off the essence of being a regular joe like the rest of us, always being planted in unusual situations.. M bends the comic book hero genre and gives it a face lift.  You either love this one or hate it.	2
1812	The Little Prince	Feels like two stories - the classic Little Prince and a cookie cutter cliche-full Hollywood cartoon awkwardly mashed together. Had the classic tale (which was beautifully animated) been given the lions share of the running time it might have worked somewhat. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.	0
1813	Mandy	An intriguing film that fell flat for me as it dragged on. Nic Cage provided some shining moments but in the end it didn't live up to my expectations. Great soundtrack though.	2
1814	Shrek 2	even better than the first one	1
1815	Pulp Fiction	The type of movie you can watch once a month and never get tired of, no matter how many references and quotes of it you make in real life.	0
1816	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	destined to be a cult classic.  Robert Downey Jr can do no wrong in my book and who would have thought that Val Kilmer still had it in him!	2
1817	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	probably one of the best mixes of comedy and drama.	2
1818	Shrek 2	As funny as the first.	2
1819	Annie	Sci fi dystopian horror flick where a child and her dog become sex slaves and die in an open sewer. 	1
1820	The Birds	Strange even for Hitchcock. Hard to say whether Tippy Hedren's affectless performance was what Hitch wanted, or because she couldn't act. Possibly a bit of both. Is it an allegory for nuclear war?	0
1821	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	probably one of the best mixes of comedy and drama.	2
1822	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	destined to be a cult classic.  Robert Downey Jr can do no wrong in my book and who would have thought that Val Kilmer still had it in him!	2
1823	The Incredibles	Fucking A Aewsome	1
1824	Suicide Squad	Suicide Squad is an utterly nonsensical soulless borefest. The only thing going for it is that it unintentionally comes across as a parody. The enemies are literally faceless. The dialogue is cringeworthy, especially the ethnic part and sometimes sounds like a voice-over. The use of music is terrible, it is hard to imagine that anyone seriously thought it was good. I've never seen anything try so hard to come across as edgy while playing it safe. And i haven't even mentioned how stupid it is.	1
1825	The Boy in the Striped Pajamas	I wrote a whole essay on the book of this for college. While the book is better (yet a very frustrating read at time because of the way the author has the boy speak) the movie did the book great justice. In some senses they made the boy less ignorant in the movie then the book. It is nice to have a different perspective of the holocaust. If you liked this, check out Watership Down.	2
1826	Dances with Wolves	I love the score, the ponderous tempo, the amazing landscape shots.  I loved the message about friendship and loyalty.  Never been so ashamed to be a white man.	2
1827	Spies Like Us	Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. 	1
1828	Birdman	Pretentious and emotionally hollow. 	0
1829	Visitor Q	A Takashi Miike filme about family values. The blackest of humor. Like a pungent cheese only recommended to the hardcore.	2
1830	Fight Club	Can't talk about it. Refer to rule #1	1
1831	The Incredibles	Fucking A Aewsome	1
1832	Suicide Squad	Suicide Squad is an utterly nonsensical soulless borefest. The only thing going for it is that it unintentionally comes across as a parody. The enemies are literally faceless. The dialogue is cringeworthy, especially the ethnic part and sometimes sounds like a voice-over. The use of music is terrible, it is hard to imagine that anyone seriously thought it was good.

1833	The Boy in the Striped Pajamas	I wrote a whole essay on the book of this for college. While the book is better (yet a very frustrating read at time because of the way the author has the boy speak) the movie did the book great justice. In some senses they made the boy less ignorant in the movie then the book. It is nice to have a different perspective of the holocaust. If you liked this, check out Watership Down.	2
1834	Dances with Wolves	I love the score, the ponderous tempo, the amazing landscape shots.  I loved the message about friendship and loyalty.  Never been so ashamed to be a white man.	2
1835	Spies Like Us	Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. 	1
1836	Alien: Covenant	Incoherent in every conceivable aspect, Covenant feels like an insult not merely to the original Alien film, but to the horror genre as a whole. 	0
1837	Birdman	Pretentious and emotionally hollow. 	0
1838	Visitor Q	A Takashi Miike filme about family values. The blackest of humor. Like a pungent cheese only recommended to the hardcore.	2
1839	Memento	This movie is brilliant even though I hate gimmicks, at the end the gimmick melts away to reveal that it adds an entirely new dimension to the film.  Amazing.	2
1840	Toy Story	One of the most revolutionary pieces of movie art turns out to be a CGI movie that was targetted mainly for kids but has plenty for watchable factors for all ages. Toy Story is the perfect animation movie with so many memorable characters, quotes, scenes and scenarios. The only flaw I have with the movie I have is an unfair one and that is the animation. Being the first Pixar, its understandable but the human animations and the animation for the dog truly looked bad at times	2
1841	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Hate this movie. I know that's not a popular opinion, but I always felt this movie was corny, overcalculated, intelectually dishonest and a bit of a cheater of a film. I wish crazy was just being a bit eccentric! As a depiction of madness is far from realist, as a metaphor of america at the time it just tries too hard but falls short of acomplishing anything but just cliched ideas. Some good acting make this one passable. I still think it's populist to portray crazy people as inspired geniuses	1
1842	Mr. Holland's Opus	Very insipiring movie, no matter your profession. 	0
1843	Mustang	"No need to talk about the cinematic goofs, just the ending, fleeing to İstanbul, from the countryside to a big city is reflected as an escape with all those beautiful-like scenes from İstanbul, as if the patriarch was not present in the metropolitan, is problematic in its approach to possibly the most important problems of modern society.
Sorry, in İstanbul, just like in some remote village in North-East Turkey, women are experiencing the same, maybe, even harsher."	0
1844	X2: X-Men United	This is my favorite comic book film of all time, so far. It is as if the actors needed one film under their belt to get the feel of the characters. The story and acting are well done.	2
1845	House of 1000 Corpses	Sid Haig from out of nowhere. Lesser men have won Oscars for worse performances.	0
1846	Jurassic World	This film is brilliantly subversive, a pastiche of modern cultural cynicism. The park's re-open, and John Hammond's naturalist approach isn't profitable anymore so they genetically engineer a new dino, and then get it presented by Verizon Wireless - guess what goes wrong? Excellent throwbacks to the original film throughout too. Chris Pratt maybe not my first choice in this role, but he tries and the result is watchable. A well-formed action/monster film with some good chuckles throughout.	2
1847	3 Ninjas	I had no idea Michael Douglas was in this movie!	0
1848	Demolition Man	How can you not like this movie?  Snipes has yellow hair!	1
1849	The Thing	It still works! Take a notice on who is the Thing at different times.	2
1850	Grey Gardens	Heartbreaking, eerie, and hilarious often at the same time. It's almost like a real life Sunset Boulevard but with two Norma Desmonds for the price of one. The Mayles brothers let the Beales women speak for themselves rather than impose a story on their footage like so many documentarians do. This is what makes Grey Gardens a masterpiece.	0
1851	Blade Runner 2049	Something like a 90 for atmosphere/visuals and a 79 for everything else 	1
1852	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs	one of the most enjoyable animated movies i've seen.  it's extremely well written with lots of hilarious moments and surprisingly complex characters.  the voice talent is also very impressive.  bill hader and anna faris are awesome as the two leads and james caan makes you fall in love with flint's metaphor spouting father.  the end of the film is filled with enough peril to keep both kids and adults entertained, and i loved how everything came full circle (even the shoes).  don't miss this one.	2
1853	Toy Story	One of the most revolutionary pieces of movie art turns out to be a CGI movie that was targetted mainly for kids but has plenty for watchable factors for all ages. Toy Story is the perfect animation movie with so many memorable characters, quotes, scenes and scenarios. The only flaw I have with the movie I have is an unfair one and that is the animation.

1855	Mr. Holland's Opus	Very insipiring movie, no matter your profession. 	0
1856	Captain America: The Winter Soldier	Marvel takes the Iron Man 1 plot formula and applies it to the Cap. The results are a VAST improvement for this hero. The most significant element is, of course, the action; in a word, incredible. Marvel has some talented choreographers and they're work is apparent here. The action is largely grounded and gritty vs. the CG frenzy of other Marvel films. The plot is as derivative and cliche as any other superhero film, though I admire the valiant, though weak, attempt at a political commentary.	2
1857	War of the Worlds	There are some really strange and horrific things going on in this movie that bump it up onto the shoulders of a lot of other summer blockbusters and disaster movies. More importantly, there's a good balance between the macro (aliens invading) and the micro (family bonding) that could easily have been forgotten.	2
1858	Nosferatu	Hasn't really aged too well - but still incredibe cinematically for 1922, and a worthy watch. Just don't go too out of your way to find it.	1
1859	Shutter Island	Atuações, trilha incidental, fotografia (uma das melhores do Scorsese), edição e movimentos de câmera primorosos (dignas de um mestre em plena forma). O filme tem um ritimo lento, que com certeza irá afastar os preguiçosos que só querem ver mais um suspense comum. Shutter Island é tudo menos comum, se não pelo roteiro, pelas técnicas empregadas pelo melhor diretor em atividade. É muito recompensador para mim como fã, ver que o Scorsese não se acomodou nem um pouco após ganhar seu Oscar.	1
1860	House at the End of the Street	The house wasn't even at the end of the street...	1
1861	Snowpiercer	kapitalist sisteme ihtilalin, devrimin entegresini islemek istemis ama derinlik yok filmde. surukleyici, aksiyonu yuksek ve teknik anlaminda basarili yine de.	1
1862	Apocalypse Now	I usually say this is my favorite movie. So yeah.	2
1863	Predators	Fun action.  Got exactly what I expected.	2
1864	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	The Life Aquatic is a great movie for the people with a good sense of humor to weed out their bad friends with. The next time someone tells me they thought this was a boring movie, I know to never take them seriously again.	2
1865	X-Men: The Last Stand	The director does matter, it is obvious. Without Brian Singer, X-men 3 is no  better than Fantastic Four.	0
1866	The Shape of Water	An impossible love story between a girl and an outsider. Beautifully put. Amazing acting, both leading and supporting.	2
1867	Memento	Thank you Christopher Nolan for this wonderful and complex thriller like no other.  Excellent story, great filming technique, and solid performances from all involved make this one of those movies you never forget.	2
1868	Avatar	i gotta say, this is not a good movie. story is same with some other 50 movies. the one phenomenon or we call saviour at the same time. and a war between nations/races. we all have seen this before, perhaps fifty times. yeah i have to admit this is amazingly beautiful in terms of graphics. also deserves all the technical oscar rewards and for that we adore all the men behind the camera besides James Cameron. This is just great technology, not great movie.	2
1869	American Pop	This movie touched me and chilled me albeit not having any coherent plot. the animation characters play really well. (I am rotoscope tolerable). the story of the last century (up to the end of the 80's) through the life of a Jewish family and the musical mainstream genres of the decades.	0
1870	The Shape of Water	An impossible love story between a girl and an outsider. Beautifully put. Amazing acting, both leading and supporting.	2
1871	Memento	Thank you Christopher Nolan for this wonderful and complex thriller like no other.  Excellent story, great filming technique, and solid performances from all involved make this one of those movies you never forget.	2

1874	Capote	Average film propelled by a blistering performance from Phillip Seymour Hoffman.	2
1875	Kristy	I'm not sure what film others were watching, but I found this to be a refreshing slasher, with an intelligent protagonist that actually made logical choices, and the less logical ones were very understandable, considering the emotional state she finds herself in.  Also, the tech aspect was actually fairly well-grounded.  I won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but anyone familiar with Black Hat/DEFCON wouldn't be shocked at the film's tech twist.	2
1876	Antichrist	i'd run into traffic to avoid gainsbourg on the street.	0
1877	Gladiator	a hollywood movie without happy end	0
1878	Rosetta	It's so real .. that's life !! ..	2
1879	Grave of the Fireflies	Okay. You both die. I don't care.	1
1880	The Way, Way Back	I'm not sure how this will hold up to repeat viewings, because every character and every scene is just a little too cutesy or quirky.  Nonetheless, on first view, it's entertaining, and I'm a sucker for coming of age stories.	2
1881	Four Lions	Noteworthy directorial debut and intelligent, side-splitting satire of radical Islamic terrorism, featuring Mujahideen so dim-witted they undermine their own plots.	1
1882	Citizen Kane	# 1	1
1883	Warcraft	I was actually expecting this to be much worse than I found it to be. It was good fun, don't take it too seriously.	0
1884	Dancer in the Dark	Either this is a brilliant prank that should go on the annals of trolling, or an amazingly ham-fisted tragedy. Lars von Trier keeps the pretence of spontaneous, honest cinema even as he uses over 100 hand-held cameras to shoot elaborate dance sequences, Björk plays the part of Björk, and the film tries as hard as it possibly can to draw tears. At best, this is a curious tragedy and a hefty tear-jerker; at worse, it's contrived, manipulative, and a two-hour insult to one's intelligence.	0
1885	The Brady Bunch Movie	Postmodern lampooning done to near-perfection.	2
1886	The Wicker Man	This movie gets a score of 3. 1 point for each time Nicolas Cage punches a girl in the face. The rest of the movie is shit.	0
1887	13 Reasons Why	Very mixed bag here. I found it fairly gripping and there were quite a few characters that I liked. Biggest flaws here include some occasionally sloppy and forced story telling, a confused message and tone (in my opinion), some cheap cliff-hangers, and an underwhelming ending (barring the bathtub scene which was pretty powerful) that felt really unnatural. Overall, entertaining but extremely flawed.	0
1888	John Carter	I am shocked at the indiscriminate trashing of this film while other garbage films get a high ranking.  Did people go and see it first?  I really like it.  I thought that it brought the book to life in a very creative way.  It is a good visual movie.  Taylor Kitsch's performance meshing well with the acutal character profile and understated does work people.  I read a review on Rotten Tomatoes that said, forget the naysayers and just go and see it; -- so I did and I am glad that I followed that 	2
1889	*batteries not included	Silly 80's sci-fi film targeted for the whole family	0
1890	Manos: The Hands of Fate	It goes far beyond the its so bad its good field, crosses the turkey spot and just moves further and further into the woods.. so far it just reaches some kind of outer limit and pure wilderness.. and when you look up at it, you can see god. 	1
1891	Repo! The Genetic Opera	...fans of Mamma Mia! won't be too thrilled	1
1892	Grave of the Fireflies	Okay. You both die. I don't care.	1
1893	The Way, Way Back	I'm not sure how this will hold up to repeat viewings, because every character and every scene is just a little too cutesy or quirky.  Nonetheless, on first view, it's entertaining, and I'm a sucker for coming of age stories.	2
1894	Four Lions	Noteworthy directorial debut and intelligent, side-splitting satire of radical Islamic terrorism, featuring Mujahideen so dim-witted they undermine their own plots.	1
1895	Citizen Kane	# 1	1
1896	Leap Year	Leap Year? MORE LIKE SLEEP YEAR! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!	0
1897	Arif v 216	İçinizde halen bu tarz filmlere T9-T10 verilmeyeceğini bilmeyen hayvanlar var. Kızmayın yahu Şabanoğlu Şaban filminden gönderme yaptım. Sonuçta sizin için film senaryosu önemli değil. Gönderme(!) olsun yeter.	1
1898	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	There were a few confusing points and A LOT of plot to sift through, but it's still a solid flick. The palace guards thought they were all Power Rangers.	2
1899	Drive	Touching, moody film. This movie is a well crafted crime drama. Gosling puts up a great performance.	2
1900	Avengers: Endgame	While Endgame is by no means a perfect film, it is a perfect love letter to the MCU.	1
1901	West Side Story	For a dancer this is a perfect movie. I was taken to the Melbourne stage version of West Side Story at the Princess Theatre in early 1961, when I was six weeks old. Ronnie Arnold, who was brought out from America to perform in the show, put me on the stage and declared that I was going to be a dancer. He was right! And I still love the movie too. 	2
1902	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Kasaba, tabela, şerif, cinayet, anne, suçlular aramizda, değişim (dunkofun değişimi), irkcilik, karakol, intihar, kanser (Tecavüz edilip öldürülen bir kizin annesi katillerin bulunmamasi neticesinde şehir disindaki üç talebalyi kiralar ve şeriften katilleri bulmalarini ister. Şerif ise kanser hastasidir. Anne azimle katillerin bulunmasi için çabalar. Bu arada geçmişte yaşananlari da öğreniriz. BOL KÜFÜRLÜ. 	1
1903	Vox Lux	a film which tries so hard to make a statement about celebrity and pop culture but ends up falling into lazy, cynical, mean-spirited pre-poptimist clichés. the more i think about it, the more i find reasons to dislike this film.	0
1904	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1	I'm not sure why they had to split it into two parts.  It felt unnecessary.  It felt stretched, slow and almost boring.  The effects and site sets were well done, but I wanted to to see the story progress more.	0
1905	The Birds	I'm normally not a horror film person, but I really like most Hitchcock and this one is great	2
1906	Fracture	a like it###	1
1907	Inception	The best movie of the year!	2
1908	Get Out	Get Out is a suspenseful, unsettling, and substantially frightening affair which rivals or surpasses the best horror films made in recent years. Get Out gets an extra leg up, however, by its obvious commentary regarding race relations, which is not shoehorned into the plot, but instead an important part of it. I don't think many of the best horror films in the last decade have had anything quite as important to say as Get Out.	2
1909	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	"25 only because this movie looks good, but it worth a 0 to me.
Seriously, this is just A new hope - character development - stakes + a LOT of jokes to remember you that a good movie was done 38 years ago + a LOT inconsistencies (why is there a rebellion leads by Leia Organa while the galactic governement is the Republic SHE took in place ? Saber call ? etc.).

It does not only fail as a good Star Wars, but also as a good sequel and as a good movie. 

But it look good. And BB-8 is really fun"	2
1910	The Revenant	I might be saying this to any Dicaprio movie, but this time it's different: What a performance with almost no talking! The same goes for Tom Hardy, with a little more speech though. 	0
1911	10,000 B.C.	A mammoth waste of time.	0
1912	Isle of Dogs	maybe it's cute, but it has some serious unheeded points. firstly, such a rebellion is quite romantic. interruption of a dictator's speech is so unrealistic today. secondly, it is annoying that all dogs want to own a master. chief was reflecting the opposite idea and we saw its change through the film. it's like saying the unwanted groups must always perform the commands of the power. finally, why can only an exchange student see the conspiracy and lead the community? because she's american.	2
1913	Big Hero 6	I wouldn't mind seeing this become a series.	1
1914	Guardians of the Galaxy	This movie actually made my year. It pulled off the lots, and lot of good humor. The kind of humor that you actually laugh at loud. Not just a smile. Not just a inner heckle. An actual life. It was a play on science fiction and action of all kinds and a breath of fresh air, right from the very beginning. From the very beginning, you know this was going to be something far different from the norm. I don't know of anyone who wouldn't enjoy this fill. I truly did.	2
1915	Spectre	Better than average Bond film. Beautiful camera work.	2
1916	The Hunchback of Notre Dame	Great score, good story, plus great performance by Tony Jay, makes this a classic.	2
1917	District 9	FUCKING INCREDIBLE	2
1918	Death Wish	Passable revenge flick which erred on the side of caution.	1
1919	Fearless	i think that it was amasing i just love jet li	1
1920	Fearless	i think that it was amasing i just love jet li	1
1921	Napoleon Dynamite	How long were you quoting this movie after it came out??  You're still doing it aren't you. Me too.	0
1922	Up in the Air	Se a força de 'Up In The Air' encontra-se no roteiro ágil e na ótima atuação de Clooney, o que me chamou a atenção foram os pequenos detalhes: os planos próximos dos personagens, como se revelassem uma intimidade escondida; a música no final dos créditos; alguns fragmentos de diálogos soltos e vazios; a quebra de expectativas. Ainda assim, reunindo esses fatos citados, são insuficientes para dar substância a um filme. Mas interligados a um propósito maior, we are floating in space.	2
1923	Tears of the Sun	it was really sad but i don't quite remember it	1
1924	28 Days Later	I think this film is very well done, and one of Boyle's best. A sci-fi, suspense, zombie film is the best way to describe it. Murphy puts in a great performance. Backing soundtrack is pretty much perfect. A classic.	2
1925	Inglourious Basterds	A movie which should serve as a lesson to movie-makers HOW should cinema be made. Amazing performance by Christoph Waltz, top-notch dialogue, perfectly created scenes. Just the first 2 minutes of the movie - the Nazi's approach towards the farm - make this movie legendary. Tarantino at his best. And the ending is true - if more films like this one are made, kino or cinema, will truly save the world.	2
1926	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	I#m really sorry, but *this* Lex Luthor and his stupid nonsensical scheme are unforgivable ... and I'm actually someone who could live with the rest (though I would have hoped for Batman to turn Superman to the light).	0
1927	Slumdog Millionaire	It's City of God with a terrible terrible game show plot element. Watch City of God instead, Paper Planes is a good song.	2
1928	Four Rooms	Tim Roth puts everything he has into his character and it is an absolute blast to watch. 	2
1929	Spookies	The making of story is better than the actual movie and explains a lot about how the resulting extraordinarily nonsensical and confusing story line came to be, but the creature effects are the real reason to watch (some early work by a 16 year old Gabe Bartalos is featured) and it's still a fun enjoyable while opaque watch.  Would love to see a release of the original Twisted Souls cut, but I still highly recommend for those looking for oozy, grimy, Evil Dead influenced low budget film making.	2
1930	Detachment	I haven't seen a film so beautiful and moving in such a long time. I have seen destructive education systems first hand and this film strikes a chord. As expected great filmmaking, stellar acting and a lasting effect.	2
1931	District 9	Very good movie...A lot of important lessons learned.	2
1932	Toy Story	Cool animated movie, that is funny not only for kids, but also has sophisticated homurous elements.	2
1933	Taxi Driver	It's like Fight Club of the 1970s; it captures the mood of what it's like to be a single man in its time and place.	1
1934	Four Rooms	Tim Roth puts everything he has into his character and it is an absolute blast to watch. 	2
1935	The Notebook	SO effing Cliche.. 	0
1936	Spookies	The making of story is better than the actual movie and explains a lot about how the resulting extraordinarily nonsensical and confusing story line came to be, but the creature effects are the real reason to watch (some early work by a 16 year old Gabe Bartalos is featured) and it's still a fun enjoyable while opaque watch.  Would love to see a release of the original Twisted Souls cut, but I still highly recommend for those looking for oozy, grimy, Evil Dead influenced low budget film making.	2
1937	Resident Evil	Den holder ikke helt. Gode intensioner, enkelte gode scener, men størstendels rodet og billig de forkerte steder..	1
1938	The Dark Tower	Another book ruined 	0
1939	Spaceballs	Brooks' style is greatly appreciated in what could have (or should have) been a terrible film. Instead it comes out well with Brooks using his self aware humour to create something truly funny.	2
1940	The Dark Tower	Another book ruined 	0
1941	Spaceballs	Brooks' style is greatly appreciated in what could have (or should have) been a terrible film. Instead it comes out well with Brooks using his self aware humour to create something truly funny.	2
1942	No Country for Old Men	I was blown away the first time I saw this movie	0
1943	Zeitgeist: The Movie	After wasting a few hours of my life trying to convince my gullible friend how false every claim in this movie is, I hate it with passion. You'd find more facts in Avatar.	0
1944	A Star Is Born	Cooper does his best impression of Jeff Bridges and Lady Gaga plays herself with a shorter nose. Jokes aside, it's a moving epic that left a lasting impression. Feels great to watch a good movie after one of the worst summers ever. 	0
1945	Batman Begins	Christopher Nolan brought back Batman with style here in this superb opening installment. A genuinely dark production with many pieces of quotable dialogue, memorable moments and marvellous acting all combine to make a spectacular reboot.	2
1946	The Return of the Living Dead	A great horror film that stands as both a parody and homage. You mean the movie lied?!	2
1947	Memento	Didn't get it.	1
1948	Ebola Syndrome	Probably one of the sleeziest films I have ever seen. Is Wong's performance good or bad? Is it good because it is him how he thinks he looks during sex, or is it bad because it's how he thinks everybody looks while having sex? Wong is what makes this film truly fascinating. The rest is in itself the typical fun trash stupidity you get in every B-Movie. Watch it!	0
1949	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Burn in hell Lucas.	0
1950	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Burn in hell Lucas.	0
1951	City of God	I can watch this movie all fucking day. Nothing like it has ever been made and anything that tries to mimick it will never come close.	0
1952	The Incredibles	My second-favorite Pixar movie. Brad Bird is an INCREDIBLE director.	2
1953	The 400 Blows	A beautiful and sensitive film, without being very sentimental. The childhood has a happy and sweet side, but also sad and bitter side. The world can be very hard with a child. It's funny the irony with the maximum three of the French Revolution: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity...	2
1954	Saturday Night Fever	If you have only seen the PG version, it is not the same movie. The original has adult themes, swearing, rape, racism and violence. Travolta is amazing as Tony. He gives the character an immaturity and ignorance that is so believable, especially in t...(read more) he family scenes. And the soundtrack and dancing are pretty good too.	2
1955	Her	A completely believable future.  I found myself identifying how easily I could fall into this situation, which I think is why I liked this movie.  If it were a traditional relationship, I don't know if it would have kept my interest just because there wouldn't have been enough to separate it from another romantic comedy other than Leaf's performance/character.	0
1956	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Perhaps the best pure adventure movie ever made.	2
1957	Religulous	the work of an incredible asshole.	2
1958	While You Were Sleeping	Better than you'd expect Romantic Comedy	2
1959	Dangerous Liaisons	Michelle and Uma in one movie. Paradise on a screen	1
1960	Tangled	The horse is the best character in the whole film, hands down. :D	0
1961	Dangerous Liaisons	Michelle and Uma in one movie. Paradise on a screen	1
1962	Antichrist	Oh Lars...	1
1963	Platoon	 A overdramatized, but ultimately harrowing and insightful look into the themes of the Vietnam War. An American Classic.	2
1964	Zodiac	An ethralling, entertaining, and realistic look at one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in this country's history. Downey and Gyllenhaal both give amazing performances, and the multiple storylines mostly succeed in showing us the many different theories and perceptions about the Zodiac killer.  Too bad the police story isn't nearly as interesting as the story involving the reporters or the cartoonist.	1
1965	Audition	kiri kiri kiri kiriiiiiii	1
1966	The Thing	I knew next to nothing about this before I watched it, was totally unprepared for how excellent it is.	0
1967	Shrek 2	As good or better than the first Shrek. There is plenty of grown-up humor. During the giant Gingerbread Man battle I laughed until I almost cried.	2
1968	Attack the Block	Main characters are completely loathsome. That could have worked well - two opposing forces, both intent on violence and harm fighting it out. Instead the kids get an ill-thought-through redemption arc, becoming heroic saviours by default.	1
1969	The Black Gestapo	It was enjoyable in the so bad, it's good kind of way. Had it moments of cool shots or ideas (like muffled music under water). So 70s it made me grown an afro. Not skimpy with the nudity too.	0
1970	Platoon	 A overdramatized, but ultimately harrowing and insightful look into the themes of the Vietnam War. An American Classic.	2
1971	Batman Begins	How could they have messed this up? Christian Bale is by far the worst Batman so far, and the over acting in this movie took away the dark and dreary atmosphere and almost moved the movie close to being campy, and it wasn't even trying to be. 	0
1972	The Shawshank Redemption	i honestly cannot come up with a single thing that i dislike about this film.  i hesistate to give it a 100, but when you can find no personal fault in a film, might as well swing for the fence.  one of the greatest films ever.	2
1973	Rashomon	Structurally daring, and I love the last, completely unglamourous fight scene. It's hard to really connect to anything, though, since all three of the major players are awful people, regardless of whose story you're trusting. I admire Kurosawa's reluctance to give us easy answers and explanations, but this film is more of a very artful puzzle than something with real heart and feeling.	2
1974	The Devil Wears Prada	While Hathaway's dialogue is often trite, and her wannabe-hip, politically correct friends are the bane of this film's existence, overall it's totally satisfying. And, for those of us lame-o's who give a shit about the difference between cerulean and turquoise, quite funny.	0
1975	M	It's a 1930s flick so it's not graphic, which plays to its advantage in my opinion.  Unlike a modern movie, which would gratuitously emphasize the violence with bloody corpses and screaming children, this one focuses on the deleterious effects of a deranged murderer upon a society, the difficulty of catching such a criminal, and the lengths people will go to in order to finally bring him to justice.	2
1976	The Bone Collector	Formulaic but reasonably fun to watch	2
1977	Toy Story	One of my favorites. 	2
1978	Planes, Trains and Automobiles	As close to perfect as a comedy can get - A fantastic double act, wonderful cameos, frantic pace, terrific writing and one of the funniest set pieces in movie history. And that ending... If you don't get choked up, you deserve a beating.	2
1979	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Classic must-see film. And then see it again!	2
1980	Toy Story	One of my favorites. 	2
1981	Planes, Trains and Automobiles	As close to perfect as a comedy can get - A fantastic double act, wonderful cameos, frantic pace, terrific writing and one of the funniest set pieces in movie history. And that ending... If you don't get choked up, you deserve a beating.	2
1982	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Classic must-see film. And then see it again!	2
1983	Let the Right One In	Completely original and beautiful. And it's a toss up for best scene; cats, hospital window, opening the blinds or swimming pool. Stunning. 	1
1984	Abducted in Plain Sight	Aptly summarized by IMDb, it is legitimately stranger than fiction. A seriously bizarre story told by 4 completely insane people, the police investigators are the only ones keeping us on this planet.	0
1985	Zombieland	it starts really good but then turns into crappy teen flick	0
1986	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Clear case of a sequel that should not have been made. Jump the shark moment: surviving a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator.	0
1987	The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D	I would rather have my own colon violently scrubbed with a metal brush than have to watch this pile of piss again.	0
1988	Moneyball	Based on a book I loved, they decided what story to tell first and used the parts of the book that amplified that story. It was somewhat quiet, and under-stated, which I thought was a nice refresher from all the movies lately that want to fill every event with a blaring sound track. Pitt was Pitt, Jonah was Jonah, and it worked. I had a smile on my face through most of the movie. It was funny, charming, and engaging.  Couldn't have asked for a better execution. 	2
1989	Funny People	After both Judd Apatow's and Seth Rogan's last few films, I have been disappointed by each of them to the point where I expected to be disappointed with this movie too.  But I was actually very impressed by this movie.  Why I liked it: It was relatable, insightful and the love story was not sappy or corny or unbelieveable (like other Apatow films where a total awkward loser gets the girl.)  This film had depth and great character development. Worth seeing.	1
1990	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Clear case of a sequel that should not have been made. Jump the shark moment: surviving a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator.	0
1991	Furry Vengeance	A thin premise stretched far beyond serviceable length, Furry Vengeance subjects Brendan Fraser -- and the audience -- to 92 minutes of abuse.	0
1992	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Even someone as talented as Wright couldn't save this film from its awful source material.	0
1993	Gone Girl	The ending was rather unbeliavable which brought the overall rating down for me. There were other inconsistencies/plotholes too, but they didn't bother me that much at the time. Rosamund Pike was great and I liked Tyler Perry too in his part.	0
1994	Gladiator	heavily overrated, which doesn't mean it's a bad film. then again, with ridley at the helm (along with the reputation of this film) i was expecting more... the lack of any sort of gray area can be trying; maximus is a model citizen who is endlessly wronged, and commodus is a incestuous asshole who is wholly evil. three cheers for multifaceted characters!	1
1995	Serenity	wonderful movie.  One of the best sci fi television series beautifully adapted into a movie.	2
1996	The Impossible	An emotional rollercoaster throughout. Totally knackered once it was over and needed a strong drink! Terrific effects but so so draining.	2
1997	Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace	Fuck you, George Lucas. FUCK YOU.	2
1998	Raiders of the Lost Ark	By far the best of a classic series, despite what certain designers of certain movie web sites might claim....	2
1999	The Amazing Spider-Man	Y'know, for a movie about the jokingest superhero in town, this movie is GRIM. Not to mention the fact that there are at least two subplots that the movie abandons before the one-hour mark.  I'll freely admit that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone hit their respective characters' marks, and the other key actors did fairly well in their own rights, but great performances can't save this movie from an underwhelming script and an inexperienced director. All in all, a big letdown.	1
2000	The Matrix Revolutions	"This movie should not be evaluated without thought to how it ties in with the two preceding films in the story.  
As a final chapter in the story of Neo, Trinity, and gang it did a good job of wrapping up the storylines and explaining some of the mysteries left after watching the second in the series.
Should be watched back to back with parts 1 and 2 to be fully enjoyed."	1
2001	Sicario	A vastly overqualified cast (from director to DP to lead actors to composer) attempt to elevate a paint-by-the-numbers revenge crime drama script to a moderate success. Sicario is proof that great direction, atmosphere, performances and the like can only get you so far when the screenplay is nothing special. Additionally, the script doesn't play to any actors' strengths with the exception of Benicio del Toro. Overall, I feel underwhelmed with how much talent was involved. 	1
2002	Casablanca	An American standard, required viewing for any serious fan of cinema, and one film that lives up to the critical hype. One of a handful of American films that are defined largely by individual moments as opposed to an overall narrative or storyline (such as the patriotic singing duel between the Nazis & French patrons of Rick's cafe, Bogart's famous here's looking at you, kid line or Bogart & Claude Rains walking into the foggy distance at the end of the film). A ligitimate film masterpiece.	2
2003	Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2	Great visuals as always. 	2
2004	The Man With a Movie Camera	Quite possibly one of the most thrilling movies ever filmed, which is really saying something for a '20s Soviet documentary.	2
2005	Alan Partridge	Comedy is dead.	1
2006	Death Note	As its own movie, it starts out okay but quickly becomes ridiculous and stupid. As an adaption of a great anime, it's atrocious. It has no understanding of any of the characters, and wipes its ass with the rules of Death Note multiple times. If you've never seen anything Death Note, there's no reason to watch this movie over the series, which is also on Netflix as of this movie's release.	0
2007	Furry Vengeance	A thin premise stretched far beyond serviceable length, Furry Vengeance subjects Brendan Fraser -- and the audience -- to 92 minutes of abuse.	0
2008	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Even someone as talented as Wright couldn't save this film from its awful source material.	0
2009	Gone Girl	The ending was rather unbeliavable which brought the overall rating down for me. There were other inconsistencies/plotholes too, but they didn't bother me that much at the time. Rosamund Pike was great and I liked Tyler Perry too in his part.	0
2010	The Thing	Best science fantasy movie I've seen.  In 50 years...	2
2011	Walking Tall	I wanted to see The Rock hit more people (like that old lady) with the two by four thing...it had a good idea, though.	2
2012	Enter the Void	another one of my all time favourites. i love that it's designed to make you uncomfortable, like getting through the whole thing is a feat of endurance. it's agonisingly long at almost 3 hours, with repetitive panning shots of japan and psychedelic imagery throughout. every scene is a shock to your senses, and you feel physically drained after watching it - what more could you want from a film.  	2
2013	Annihilation	The flashbacks and flashforwards were bullshit and unnecessary. And so it was the sciencish DNA refraction explanation of what was going on. The introductory part and the characters were also kind of weak but didn't damage the movie like the former defects. Other than that, great film.	0
2014	Poltergeist	The specificity of the art direction and costumes makes this stand out more as an 80s design lesson than a serious horror film. Think brass, wicker, rattan, fake house plants, formica, etc... but in a really good, satisfying way.	2
2015	G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra	Sinking ice. There was SINKING ICE. Forget terrible dialog, cardboard cutout characters, wooden acting, and...I'd mention the plot if there was one. THERE WAS SINKING ICE >:-(	0
2016	La Jetée	I thought the idea of a film using still images to be some kind of art bullshit gimmick. However the effect is quite profound. It taps into something about the nature of time, and memories. It feels something like you are watching memories, which ofcourse you are. Set all Twelve Monkeys comparisons aside, the simliarities are superficial.  It's more of an art piece that a piece of entertainment, not something that I usually look for, but at 20 minutes running time I can deal with that.	0
2017	A Cure for Wellness	Went to see this movie with my girl in hopes of casually making out throughout the film and losing my cinema-kiss virginity. This expectation got completely shattered during the commercials when this weird looking guy sat right next to me (who doesn't keep a goddamn empty seat in-between?) and some guy from class seated himself in front of me, making me feel way too conscious about the entire ordeal and thus forcing me to actually pay attention to the movie. It's a piece of shit.	0
2018	Forrest Gump	A saccharine monument to stupidity and stoicism.  	1
2019	Velvet Goldmine	Ewan MacGregor.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  Christian Bale.  Eddie Izzard.  I love these men, and some of them DO IT WITH EACH OTHER.  This film, to me, is revered the way the vast majority of straight boys I know revere the film Bound.  I LOVE IT.	2
2020	Haywire	Soderbergh's direction and Carano's convincing physicality help to overcome a second rate action/thriller script. The action sequences are truly the highlight here, as Carano's ability allows for a visceral feel without resorting to frenetic editing.	2
2021	Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill	Possibly the best of his live shows.  The Englebert Humperdink segment is a classic.	2
2022	Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed	I HAVE FOUND IT! The Worst Movie Ever Made.	0
2023	The Little Mermaid	Classic. Gorgeous animation, amazing score, memorable songs. This movie kept Disney alive.	2
2024	I Stand Alone	A flawless portrayal of extreme hopelessness and desperation in modern day society.  Noe perfectly captures one man's downward spiral into despair and anger brought on by the conditions of an unloving and selfish society. Utilizing unique cinematic techniques and aggressive intertitles, Noe brilliantly intensifies the seething anger and grim mood of the protagonist which draws the viewer in, making Seul contre tous a personal and incredible cinematic experience.	2
2025	Solo: A Star Wars Story	The Kasdans seek coincidence and happenstance to explain away mystique-elements of the franchise's lore. The winking and hamming are distracting. Lucas is a maximalist who thought he was a minimalist, and that misunderstanding built an interesting universe. This hastily assembled group are seasoned professionals telling a dispassionate story. Studios aren't going to take chances with a $300M budget. So, we get lackluster movies. Better than VII, and much better than VIII.	0
2026	Wolf Children	"I'm so impressed. One of the best anime movies I have seen so far.
The scenery is spectacular, beautiful and peaceful. 
A lovely story and a very refreshing movie."	2
2027	The Tree of Life	The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by.	1
2028	Superman: The Movie	The part where superman files around the earth to go back in time can suck my cock.	0
2029	Black Mask	This movie can't decide what it wants to be, like a lot of martial arts movies these days.  So much potential, so little focus.  Oh well.	1
2030	The Little Mermaid	Classic. Gorgeous animation, amazing score, memorable songs. This movie kept Disney alive.	2
2031	Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill	Possibly the best of his live shows.  The Englebert Humperdink segment is a classic.	2
2032	Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed	I HAVE FOUND IT! The Worst Movie Ever Made.	0
2033	Bohemian Rhapsody	For a biopic about Freddie Mercury it wasn't very fun. Instead it was a bit doom and gloom, repressed, sanitised, poorly written with no real energy or excitement apart from the live aid recreation at the end. But even that wasn't enough to save a bad film.	0
2034	The Butler	I.....wiiiiillllllll.....veeeetoooo.....iiiiitttt:)	1
2035	Inception	This is a highly-intelligent, high-concept, sci-fi action bonanza and a fantastic achievement by writer and directer Christopher Nolan. The story is wonderfully compelling and imaginative and Hans Zimmer's score is out of this world. All you could want from an epic sci-fi adventure. Perfect.	2
2036	Hereditary	damn...i laughed hard on that episode with retarded...perhaps the compensation for 30 minutes of boredom. ...after that another 20 minutes of boredom and here comes a distant reminder that it is somewhat horror-related movie ...ok after 1h20min - above average and kinda fresh horror. ending is questionable.	2
2037	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	hell yeeeeeee ! Finally a great movie :))	2
2038	Eighth Grade	Oh man, what agony. I may not have lived the 13 year old girl life in the modern day, but I believe I can now adequately empathize with it. What a beautiful and thoughtful story this was. I have all the respect in the world for Bo, so to see his first effort into the realm of film making as something just as cutting and honest as his previous works is incredible. Absolutely loved this despite being painfully uncomfortable for a lot of it.	2
2039	Shaun of the Dead	Loved this movie! Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. This was the first movie I have watched that adds the comedic side to the usual, I will eat your brains, zombie!' way cool and a must see. If you have amovie library this should be added to it immediately. 	2
2040	Shaun of the Dead	Loved this movie! Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. This was the first movie I have watched that adds the comedic side to the usual, I will eat your brains, zombie!' way cool and a must see. If you have amovie library this should be added to it immediately. 	2
2041	Zombieland	Hated zombies before watching this one. Sat through it absolutely riveted and laughing hard. Expecting to watch it again and enjoy it thoroughly. Still hate zombies.	0
2042	Eighth Grade	Amazing and uncomfortably accurate portrayal of navigating school life with social anxiety. Some raw, relatable scenes, current day setting (as opposed to nostalgia waxing) and an active boldness to avoid common tropes make this one of the most unique modern teen films in a long, long time.	2
2043	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Third best star wars	2
2044	Rear Window	That's a classic Hitchcock stuff but there's two things that stands out better than the other films: having both disturbing and peaceful elements and achieving doing a wonderful thriller, without using lots of places..	2
2045	Bohemian Rhapsody	It was fine for what it was. The trailer portrayed it perfectly. While in no way exceptional and at times a bit corny, it was enjoyable.	2
2046	Her	"This film is very interesting. The technology and the world of the film is built brilliantly, placing us in a sort of retro-styled near future - in which we have an unconventional love story play out - which in turn gives us questions about humanity and the future of AI.
The performances are outstanding both from Johansson (who isn't physically present) and Phoenix (playing against basically nothing.)
A quaint, melancholic and sometimes darkly comic little drama."	2
2047	Serenity	One of my favorite small sci-fi movies. Better than the TV show.	2
2048	Gangster Squad	Fabulous film. Great acting, effects, and plot. Chemistry between actors was wonderful.	2
2049	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	One of the best.	2
2050	Serenity	One of my favorite small sci-fi movies. Better than the TV show.	2
2051	The Dark Knight	Christian Bale does a great job as Batman, but the truly great performance in this film is by Heath Ledger. I'm not saying that because he died. It's tragic that we lost such a great talent so young. I have always thought he was very underrated. The combination of Bale and Ledger made this film amazing. I grew up reading Batman comics, and this was not disappointing at all.	2
2052	Gangster Squad	Fabulous film. Great acting, effects, and plot. Chemistry between actors was wonderful.	2
2053	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	One of the best.	2
2054	Serenity	Having never seen the television show and barely remembering the ads, I was quite surprised at the results when I rented the DVD of the movie.  So surprised, in fact, that I bought the television shows on DVD the next day.  The reavers probably kept me from finding my way to the theaters to see it, but after seeing the movie, I can forgive Whedon the zombie-like antagonists.    This film also introduced me to Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nathan Fillion as actors both of whom seem to do an amazing job at	2
2055	Ex Machina	great drama. although there are logical fails.	2
2056	City of God	Really good. 	2
2057	Se7en	I thought I wouldn't like this movie because I usually don't see much point in doing the show for the show - a lot of blood and impressive scenes for the mere effect they produce. However, the great thing about this movie - is that there aren't such scenes (excluding the aftermath), although everyone talks about them - they are only suggested, but no shown - the viewer comes up with them, showing our imagination and mind can go well beyond we believed before it went to its sordid depths.	0
2058	The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers	You should watch the Extended Edition.	1
2059	Le Samouraï	Alain Delon glides through Melville's cold and minimalistic world as Jef Costello, a cool, calm and icy hitman with his back against the wall. Minimal dialogue, no background info, very slow, stylish and deliberate, Le Samourai is a triumph of French filmmaking, and indeed, one of the best films I've ever seen; nowadays, it would be very difficult to replicate or remake. 	2
2060	True Romance	A unique romance and another excellent performance by Gary Oldman	2
2061	The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers	You should watch the Extended Edition.	1
2062	Le Samouraï	Alain Delon glides through Melville's cold and minimalistic world as Jef Costello, a cool, calm and icy hitman with his back against the wall.

2063	Kick-Ass	This movie can't decide if invincible superheroes do (hitgirl) or don't (kick-ass) exist. After the first half hour the hero named Kick-Ass has no real role to play in this movie anymore, and the movie suddenly changes lead-role and story. So the first half of the movie doesn't need the second half of the movie and vice versa.	1
2064	The Martian	dece	1
2065	Her	so so good!	2
2066	Ferris Bueller's Day Off	A stupid teen rebellion film where the reasonable people look like the bad guys. Also not that funny.	0
2067	Inception	A beautifully crafted mystery, packed with action and mind bending ideas. I especially like how everything was tied together in the end, not leaving the audience to decide what was real.	2
2068	Apocalypto	Nice visual imagery, although creepy at times with its savage overtones. Good acting and a fair amount of action. No thinking on your part required. 	2
2069	Whiplash	I don't even like Jazz.	1
2070	Apocalypto	Nice visual imagery, although creepy at times with its savage overtones. Good acting and a fair amount of action. No thinking on your part required. 	2
2071	Whiplash	I don't even like Jazz.	1
2072	Leave No Trace	A decent film that's been done better. The girl and father have no dialogue which detracts some from another version of this movie that's been told. The father is a selfish unhappy character and you really feel for the daughter by the end. 	0
2073	Jurassic World	Predictable, maybe too much relying on nostalgia with a lot of hey remember Jurassic Park? That was a great movie! scenes. Some of the most interesting parts of the film for me was just seeing a running dinosaur theme park and the attractions they designed for it. Still, enjoyable movie.	2
2074	The Missing	A good, but slow paced, western flick with Tommy Lee Jones on the trail of his kidnapped grandaughter.	1
2075	Se7en	A very cool thriller with a great cast and cool ideas	2
2076	Logan	One of the best x-men movies. Straight forward, emotional and in my opinion a lot darker than previous movies.	2
2077	Mother!	This movie is as ugly as sin, and almost as delightful. 	0
2078	Captain Marvel	A completely forgettable super hero flick. It only exists to introduce the character into the MCU's money-printing machine. I have to admit, the sequences with the Skrulls shapeshifting added a layer of intrigue to an otherwise boring story.	2
2079	The One I Love	Basically a really funny and tense episode of the Twilight Zone.	2
2080	The One I Love	Basically a really funny and tense episode of the Twilight Zone.	2
2081	Inception	Few films have elicited so much discussion as this one here. Be sure to have plenty of energy, you will need all your attention, and possibly a pen and a notebook. It is a very intricate story, almost fractal, sustained and augmented by huge special effects. One step beyond Matrix would be an appropriate deffinition.	2
2082	Monsters	The endiing made me want to punch myself in the face 	1
2083	The Fifth Element	All-time action favourite. Great score too, particularly the diva song.	0
2084	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	This was an okay movie and I know it's a classic but I think people build it up a bit too much.	0
2085	The Matrix	This original was groundbreaking and surreal, awesome.	2
2086	300	good acting, amazing filming, a lot of blood and action! a must-see!!	2
2087	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	The best movie of 2017, no doubt!	2
2088	The Awful Truth	Sheer brilliance. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant at their absolute best. I do feel sorry for the black cat who appears to have its paw superglued ( staple-gunned? ) to the door at the end ?!?  Pure Joy !!	0
2089	Batman Begins	Shitty pacing and fight scenes that are too up close made this movie pretty goddamn annoying for me to sit through at the theater. 	0
2090	300	good acting, amazing filming, a lot of blood and action! a must-see!!	2
2091	The Fifth Element	All-time action favourite. Great score too, particularly the diva song.	0
2092	The Godfather	What can I say? If you have never watched this movie, do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece.	2
2093	You Got Served	This was the feature at our Terrible Movie Night. we were not prepared.	0
2094	A Boy and His Dog	Mad as a brush. If post-apocalyptic film with psychic dogs, main characters who are rapists and underground societies with killer robot clowns sounds good to you then check this motherfucker out.	2
2095	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	The best movie of 2017, no doubt!	2

2098	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	I think I like the book a bit better, but both are great.  Man, I should reread that book.	2
2099	Insidious: Chapter 2	Incredibly cheesy and awfully camp; Insidious Chapter 2 lacks both scares and originality resulting in a poor sequel that will please only the weakest of movie goers	0
2100	Star Trek: First Contact	Best of the Next Gen Star Trek's	2
2101	Drive	It might not be for everyone, but Drive takes the idea of pulp novels and cheesy eighties shows and puts them together for one of the most original and entertaining films of 2011. Gosling is perfect as a modern Eastwood, Brooks kills as a villain. Fantastic score as well. It's sure to become an iconic film in the years ahead.	2
2102	Cast Away	Issiz bir adaya yalniz basiniza duserseniz yaniniza hangi uc seyi alirdiniz? Peki bu uc seyi secmenize izin verilmeseydi ne yapardiniz? Tom Hanks'e secme hakki verilmemis ve o da adada ihtiyaci olan uc seyi kendisi uretme yoluna gitmis. Filmde Hanks'in yalniz oldugu kisimlar son derece iyi olmakla beraber basi ve sonu icin daha vasat diyebiliriz.	1
2103	Mad Max: Fury Road	Cirque du Soleil + testosterone. 	1
2104	Napoleon Dynamite	At what point is this movie a comedy?? What a load of ABSOLUTE BS!!!!!!!!!	0
2105	The Prince of Egypt	A truly fantastic biblical film that covered the story of Moses, complete with a few really great songs that shine and make the story grow through a lot more depth than it could have.  The relationship between Moses and Ramses was really well done too.	2
2106	Shin Godzilla	This was basically the perfect blend of body horror, disaster flicks, and political comedy.	1
2107	Inception	A completely frustratingly complex film based on a simple idea that will undoubtedly keep every single viewer discussing the movie far into the future.  A great visual treat and amazing sound scape.  You'll wish you'd seen it in the theaters.	2
2108	Bambi Meets Godzilla	I rate this short fairly high only because it brings back a great memory from 5th grade when I first saw it.  We had a substitute teacher for the day who showed this as a treat - and all the kids absolutely loved it. 	2
2109	Braveheart	Awesome soundtracks.Sign of James Horner.	2

2118	Braveheart	Awesome soundtracks.Sign of James Horner.	2
2119	Black Dynamite	I typically hate comedies, but this movie... this freaking movie.  Quite possibly the funniest movie in the last 20 years.  Incredibly quotable, really great subtle jokes blended with complete over the top silliness, and yet at the same time moments of sheer cool.  There's only one scene that runs slightly long, and even that has a pretty good pay off.  I could watch this movie every day and be happy, it's that fun.	2
2120	The Fast Runner	If this was in English, would anyone care about this stiltedly acted, badly paced, directionlessly told, idiotically written, over-long, wish-I-was-Tarkovsky soap opera?	0
2121	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Best of the series.  Love Karen Allen, the only really strong women in the entire series of films	2
2122	The Predator	This is really bad.	0
2123	City of God	A fantastic and depressing gem. The message is ingrained well amongst brilliant realistic acting and raw cinematography. 	2
2124	The Others	Great ending. Very slow action, boring for most watchers but ending is worh waiting for.	2
2125	Song of the Sea	A magical adventurous story based on Irish folklore with a bit of a melancholic air about it. The art style, soundtrack, and the colors altogether create a truly stunning and ethereal effect on the movie.	2
2126	The Machinist	Very interesting and Bale totally rules. I hate the nice prostitute, I'm sick of them. I want a whore with a heart of darkness.	2
2127	No Country for Old Men	Just not seeing the genius, masterpiece, year's best plaudits that others are piling on this movie.  It's interesting, certainly worth seeing, and has some snappy dialogue and good performances, but folks seem to be mistaking obtuse plotting and a failed ending for depth and importance.	0
2128	The Bridge on the River Kwai	classic, can't not whistle!	2
2129	Dunkirk	the only thing on this film is allways trying to get you into various desperate situations. but these scenes are not part of a topic integrity because there is nothing but greenbox and fighting toys	1
2130	Cloverfield	I can't stand the guy behind the camera	1

2133	City of God	iincredible	1
2134	Stay	This movie will twist your mind around and back again as you try to understand the motives behind the characters and the nature behind what drives them.  The real twist of this movie is only the beginning; the carefully crafted structure is worth observing.	2
2135	The Lion King	i think this is the best animation musical made ever.	2

2143	Interstellar	This film seemed promising for the first hour or so but the ending was a huge disappointment.  Of course, I went into it having been told that I was going to see things more amazing than I could possibly imagine, so perhaps my expectations were too high.  I don't think I've ever been impressed by a film that involved time travel or communication through time, and this one is no exception. The circular reasoning is just too absurd, and the visualization of the whole process was also disappointing	0

2145	Willow	Laugh all you want, but I sincerely revere this as one of the best fantasy flicks around. Flawless execution, great storytelling.	2
2146	Tropic Thunder	The first time I tried to see this, I hated it so much that I didn't even finish it. Now, I tried again and it doesn't seem so bad. It made me laugh out loud several times and I think I actually enjoyed it. I guess I just needed to turn my brain off for a while.	0

2149	Ben-Hur	We must include a huge Hollywood production (thank you director, William Wyler) with one of the greats (Charleton Heston) authentic costumes and great scenic backdrops. This film resulted in 11 Academy awards, a feat only equaled by Titantic and The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King.  This is the Biblical epic that outdoes them all with a musical score you will have difficulty getting out of your head. 	2

2156	The Godfather: Part III	Sofia Coppola, Nuff said	1
2157	A Simple Plan	It's a good, thrilling film until to the last scene by the plane then it turns up to be a dramatic one. The plot does not seem to be much promising but with the good acting and Sam Raimi's directing it is worth seeing. And Billy Bob Thornton is excellent once again.                               note to myself: If a man with a shotgun enters your kitchen  in the middle of the night don't try to shoot him... or just don't miss. And by the way if you find 4 mil. dollars don't tell it to your wife.	2

2168	Far from Heaven	A fascinating view of how an era in which, unfortunately, people's choices and honest feelings caused society to respond with lack of understanding and outright hatred. A film which doesn't try to rewrite history to be PC but presents things as they were in our country at that time. Also some absolutely beautiful cinematography 	2

 It was too long. I normally don't complain about movie length, as I believe movies should be 2 hours+ minimum, but this movie dragged on and on and on and I kept waiting and expecting it to become good. It kind of did during the second half, but the first half left me so fucking distraught from wasting the last 2 hours of my life, I just didn't care anymore.

2171	The Passion of the Christ	The worlds most powerful snuff film. If it wasn't Jesus you'd turn it off in disgust.	2

2173	Seconds	Would have worked better as a twilight zone episode instead of a full length film.	0
2174	The Room	However, don't let the rating dissuade you from watching it. While it is bad, it is GLORIOUSLY bad and highly entertaining.	0
2175	The Princess and the Frog	A classic Disney's fairy tale. I admit I expected it to be much more groundbreaking but well, it's not bad.	2
2176	Being John Malkovich	As soon as I saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. The surreal humour hits the mark perfectly. I love the way it reworks a traditional movie monster/villian 'the puppet master' in a much more psychologically indepth way. The bit when it suddenly switches to the chimp's traumatic memories is brilliant	2
2177	Predator	I first gave this a 93, but then revised it to 100 when I realized it was not missing one single element of a great movie.	0
2178	Il Successo	This is a very rare filme and a valuable one. In spite of the often visited theme of fortune against happiness, this movie approaches it uniquely, with a very impressive participation of the actors and clever dialogues.	2
2179	Death at a Funeral	a pointless remake of a brilliant british comedy. why even bother? 	0
2180	Diamonds Are Forever	One of the worst Bonds.  Why did Connery have to leave the franchise on such a low note?	0
2181	Atonement	"The first half was pretty strong I thought.So was the cinematography (throughout).
But the second half felt somewhat over-sentimental and manipulative.The ending could have been interesting but fell flat. 
Performances were decent (rather liked Saoirse)."	0
2182	Lost in Translation	The only thing that kept me watching was the anticipation that it just had to get better, it just had to, but alas it never did.	0
2183	Hannah Gadsby: Nanette	Hannah Gadsby is a gem. This is absolutely her magnum opus. It's a deeply personal piece, but one that resonates with anyone who has ever felt like they didn't fit into the mold the world expected them to. As a queer person who has always used humour as a coping mechanism, this hit home in a way that had me laughing, and then crying my heart out. A story like this is what a lot of misunderstood kids will appreciate hearing. I only hope it has an impact on the way they are treated by others.	2
2184	The Final Sacrifice	This is a terrible movie; but unlike most of the terrible movies that MST3K riffed on, this one actually had heart. I cared about what happened to Troy and Rowsdower, and it actually felt like the cast and crew were trying to do a good job (most of the MST3K movies feel a lot colder). Not something I'd want to watch without the riffing, but as far as awful movies go, this one wasn't so bad.	2
2185	The Thin Red Line	What if WW2 wore fought by pseudophilsophical retards	0
2186	Super Mario Bros.	This film confused and disappointed me even as a child.	0
2187	Gone with the Wind	"Where can I start on this atrocity? 
 
 It was too long. I normally don't complain about movie length, as I believe movies should be 2 hours+ minimum, but this movie dragged on and on and on and I kept waiting and expecting it to become good. It kind of did during the second half, but the first half left me so fucking distraught from wasting the last 2 hours of my life, I just didn't care anymore. 
 
 By the end of the movie I was thankful it was finally over. Bitch got served and I was happ"	0
2188	Far from Heaven	A fascinating view of how an era in which, unfortunately, people's choices and honest feelings caused society to respond with lack of understanding and outright hatred. A film which doesn't try to rewrite history to be PC but presents things as they were in our country at that time. Also some absolutely beautiful cinematography 	2
2189	The Princess and the Frog	A classic Disney's fairy tale. I admit I expected it to be much more groundbreaking but well, it's not bad.	2
2190	Il Successo	This is a very rare filme and a valuable one. In spite of the often visited theme of fortune against happiness, this movie approaches it uniquely, with a very impressive participation of the actors and clever dialogues.	2
2191	Death at a Funeral	a pointless remake of a brilliant british comedy. why even bother? 	0
2192	Life Is Beautiful	My favorite genre...  Holocaust comedies.	2
2193	Predator	I first gave this a 93, but then revised it to 100 when I realized it was not missing one single element of a great movie.	0
2194	Crash	Between Crash and A History of Violence, Not having sex with David Cronenberg moved up to life goal #1.	2
2195	The Thin Red Line	A reluctant group of poets take on THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN	1
2196	Cowboys & Aliens	This movie is worth watchig to see Harrison Ford play a role unusual for him. He makes a convincing miserable bad guy.	2
2197	Buena Vista Social Club	Hard to rank. The music is exceptional. The documentary is boring.	0
2198	Funny Games	Fucking terrible.  I'd rather make love to a garbage disposal	0
2199	Nashville	Complete bore. Only good for people who identify culturally with that stuff.	0
2200	Atonement	"The first half was pretty strong I thought.So was the cinematography (throughout).
But the second half felt somewhat over-sentimental and manipulative.The ending could have been interesting but fell flat. 
Performances were decent (rather liked Saoirse)."	0
2201	Lost in Translation	The only thing that kept me watching was the anticipation that it just had to get better, it just had to, but alas it never did.	0
2202	Hannah Gadsby: Nanette	Hannah Gadsby is a gem. This is absolutely her magnum opus. It's a deeply personal piece, but one that resonates with anyone who has ever felt like they didn't fit into the mold the world expected them to. As a queer person who has always used humour as a coping mechanism, this hit home in a way that had me laughing, and then crying my heart out. A story like this is what a lot of misunderstood kids will appreciate hearing. I only hope it has an impact on the way they are treated by others.	2
2203	The Final Sacrifice	This is a terrible movie; but unlike most of the terrible movies that MST3K riffed on, this one actually had heart. I cared about what happened to Troy and Rowsdower, and it actually felt like the cast and crew were trying to do a good job (most of the MST3K movies feel a lot colder).

2204	The Thin Red Line	What if WW2 wore fought by pseudophilsophical retards	0
2205	Diamonds Are Forever	One of the worst Bonds.  Why did Connery have to leave the franchise on such a low note?	0
2206	Absolutely Anything	Entertainment: 5/4 -- laugh out loud funny, and some memorable moments becoming inside jokes.  Spirit: 1.5/3.  Sustainability: 1/3.	2
2207	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Abrams brings a little fun to the series. Kinda copy of the original movie but im okay with it.	1
2208	The Silence of the Lambs	chills down my spine goodbye horses.......	1
2209	Joy	Interesting to learn about Joy.  But the dysfunction was way over the top.  Hope it was imbellished for the film....	2
2210	Thor: Ragnarok	I am so very glad this movie is more tongue-in-cheek than the previous ones and does not take itself so seriously. It was a great mix of comedy and action. Even the story line managed to hold a few surprises.  It was definitely unexpected, in a great way!	2
2211	The Ballad of Buster Scruggs	Wonderful cinema experience.	2
2212	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	A beautiful film bordering on masterpiece that might leave some wrinkling their nose in disgust, but will most certainly leave others absolutely in awe and enraptured.	2
2213	District 9	Very great concept and idea! The acting is superb and the characters develop very well and even the connection between the main character and the aliens. The music is really good. The main villain is an under developed stereotypical killing military leader and his death is quite typical at the end. The film flows quite well and the cinematography is very beautiful and well done. I admire this film for being one of the best sci-fi films and using a very good plot. Very great film! 	2
2214	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	It is hard to be a mother.	0
2215	Monsters, Inc.	One of the weaker Pixar films (it feels the most kiddish to me). However, the characters (once again) are incredibly redeeming; Boo is absolutely adorable	2
2216	Her	Spike Jonze is consistently able to play with my emotions like they're putty. Her was no different. The cast was especially flawless, but everything about the movie was wonderful and memorable.	2
2217	Avengers: Infinity War	Was I scared for this movie? Yes. Was it an okay movie? Yes. Do I have whiplash from it? Yes. Am I going to need to watch it twenty more times before I'm one hundred percent sure of how I feel about it? Definitely.	0
2218	The Martian	Matt Damon did a fantastic job in this movie, which was of course, an adventure flick, but had many humorous moments as well. The storyline was far from predictable (for those of us who hadn't read the book beforehand). The only criticism I have for it is the ethnicity-changing/white-washing of some of the characters; the woman surnamed Park was Korean-American in the novel, but a Causcasian in the movie, and the Indian Venkat Kapoor of the novel became a mixed black-Indian named Vincent.	2
2219	A Fistful of Dollars	Can't help finding it overrated, the story is overly complicated and it just seems to lack a good deal of the magic that comes later with Few Dollars More and TGTBATU. Worth watching as a matter of interest but not on its own merits, it hasn't aged well.	0
2220	District 9	When a sci-fi movie - with its aliens and robots and spaceships and lasers - shows you something about mankind and human nature, that's a movie smart enough to embrace the genre's potential.  The action towards the end is great, but where this movie really shines is in its very different portrayal of how prejudiced, self-interested humanity might react to alien visitors.	2
2221	Goodfellas	Greatest Mobster movie of all time!  Also one of the Best Movies!!	2
2222	Inception	Great film, if you're paying attention the whole way through. Fantastic use of music.	2
2223	Her	very creative, and very well written this at first silly idea is very thought out and wonderfully told	2
2224	Transformers	I wish I could rank this franchise in negative numbers, because that is the only way to accurately rank a movie that makes you feel like your fucking brain is falling out.	0
2225	Children of Men	Cuaron's vision and focus comes through in powerful spurts. Great performances throughout, and a visual feast.	2
2226	Enter the Void	I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't. This is too fucked up for me.	0
2227	Ex Machina	Ex Machina purports to be a meditation on the nature of consciousness, but ultimately abandons the philosophical for familiar themes that prevent it from making the leap to greatness. Still, it's an assured debut, boasting solid performances & some excellent visuals. A well-crafted and compelling piece of sci-fi.	2
2228	Day of the Dead	The weakest of the trilogy, but still great.	2
2229	No Country for Old Men	This movie is almost 100% true to the book. Best movie villain ever in film too!	2
2230	Day of the Dead	The weakest of the trilogy, but still great.	2
2231	No Country for Old Men	This movie is almost 100% true to the book. Best movie villain ever in film too!	2
2232	Suicide Squad	Margot Robbie does a great job as Harley despite the scripts garbage dialogue.  Jared Leto was alright as Joker but if you've seen The Dark Knight then you'll be severely disappointed with his performance.  The bad guy is poorly acted, and not developed as well as hard to watch due to how cringey her performance was.  The other villains seem like they are more good than villain and fall flat because of this.  The movie is by no means awful but sort of just there and overall forgettable.	0
2233	Now You See Me	As long as it's well packed, do we really care if it's that good? Think of the Camaro, for example. It's not that great of car, but it looks good, and people enjoy starring at it, which means it sells. To all nay sayers about this movie, this is my Camaro and I enjoy it. In fact, I think it's really good.	2
2234	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	The very-2017 and painfully-long cellphone joke in the first 5 minutes tells you everything you need to know. Hamill can't save this. Decent villain that's lost under writing that would be good for Starlords, not Skywalkers. Cgi podrace, deus-ex-machnia by the cgi goggled gram, cgi furby slapstickery, cgi milky  walrus nipples. Who let George Lucas back in here? Even decent parts die to clumsy handling - Luke was trapped by his hero status, so we close on children telling new Luke legends. What?	2
2235	Troy	Score is for directors cut. It improved theatrical cut quite a bit. 	2
2236	City of God	Amazing storytelling, another film I just wish would go on and on.	2
2237	Aladdin	Yes its that good. Doesn't matter if you are a kid or an adult.	2
2238	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Just a rehash of previous episodes.	0
2239	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Visual- great.  Story-meh.  Way to much cut and paste from previous Star Wars movies.  Considering he had literally an unwritten story, I was disappointed how close the story was to previous Episodes.	1
2240	The Horde	Très bonne surprise. Un poil superficiel, pas d'explications superflues, un peu trop de ralentis inutiles. Mais quels bons personnages, de bonnes répliques, une bonne pêche et du défouirallage en règle bien gore. Que demande le peuple ?	0
2241	The Host	Korea's monster movie doesn't disappoint. The monster's scenes are always interesting, the characters are likable, and the transitions between scenes are so cool, (remember the empty bottles transitioning to the ocean anyone?) The middle moves a little slow, and the monster CGI isn't that good, but the camera's quality and cinematography make up for these little flaws.	2
2242	Shaun of the Dead	WATCH.  THIS.  MOVIE.	1
2243	Get Out	only complaint i have about this is it should have been longer. i loved it	1
2244	Agora	Maybe a little bit boring at the beginning, but brilliant as a whole. Great presentation of christians as brain-dead motherfuckers and really stupid and fucked up sons of bitches. The last scene was incredible. I'm very grateful for showing how human (in this case Hypatia portrayed by Rachel Weisz) was able to love science. Still enjoy being atheist.	2
2245	Ex Machina	Got to love Oscar Isaac 	2
2246	Enter the Void	I could give this film a rating between about 40 and 95 and probably be able to justify it. It's long and at times tediously slow, but at the same it's an increadibly visceral and emotionally draining experience. I'm sitting here stunned after viewing it, and while I can scoff at some of the acting and the shallowness of the film's philosophy I simply can't get this out of my head. Everybody should watch it for the experience at least once. Whether it is any good or not is a different matter. 	0
2247	Swiss Army Man	Farts and boners, but... a Shane Carruth cameo. And I did laugh a few times. Not at the flatch 'n stiffies stuff, as too-obviously intended. The handmade 'movies' bit was a solid laugh. I guess I'm glad something like this exists, even if it wasn't quite what I was looking for.	0
2248	Alita: Battle Angel	Anyone who mentions uncanny valley doesn’t know what it’s supposed to mean.	1
2249	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	The very-2017 and painfully-long cellphone joke in the first 5 minutes tells you everything you need to know. Hamill can't save this.

2251	Fight Club	I am Jack's rabid fanboy. 	1
2252	It Follows	Criticker expected scores are not usually far off, but ugg this time?!  do NOT see this movie   	0
2253	It Follows	Enjoyable throwback horror with a good soundtrack and a reliable premise that somehow keeps milking suspense out of the same visual of a figure approaching in the background. Delightfully unhinged in places despite its general low-key demeanor. It's not a subtle movie but its metaphors are also not too easy to pin down. The weird, gross teenage stuff combined with the psycho-sexual nature of the curse is an awkward, unsettling stew.	2
2254	Knives Out	A murder mystery that is very well shot and stars Daniel Craig being gloriously hammy.  It is consistently funny through dialogue and its editing.  It also does some fun things thematically with the whodunnit genre that I won't describe so as not to spoil anything.  The main point against the film is that it doesn't fully utilize the suspense inherent to the genre.	2
2255	Under the Skin	Awful movie, no point in watching, loss of time.	0
2256	Jesus Camp	Scary stuff.	1
2257	Annihilation	Pretty, but I didn't love the plot.	1
2258	Doom House	You seem like a man of many words. Well let me tell you this how about: If you don't get out of this Doom House, it could spell your doom!	2
2259	The Little Mermaid	There's a lot I could say about this film, but this pretty much sums it up for me: It never gets old.	0
2260	The Raid: Redemption	vasat senaryo ve oyunculuk fena olmayan aksiyon.	1
2261	A Fistful of Dollars	i gave yojimbo 90 when i watched. But after watched this, i decided to give yojimbo 100  	1
2262	Roma	It works at many levels, and this is precisely the problem. It works, because it is so sterile; a director who internalized the most respectful aspects of modern film-making that they actually get in the way of storytelling. No clear political statement here, neither films need to do that, however in the end is there not a reconcile of classes through sadness, loss etc. which is not structural but on the opposite, very personal and contingent that you could change the losses between classes.	0
2263	The Girl Who Leapt Through Time	An excellent film that entices one to think both retroactively and proactively about one's choices and their consequences.  It would've received one tier higher had its loose ending not left a sour taste in my mouth.	2
2264	The Nightmare Before Christmas	Inventive, clever, and spectacular.	2
2265	Toy Story 3	I had to privilege to grow up with these movies; Toy Story was the first movie I ever saw in theatres, at 5 years old. Now I'm in college, just like Andy. The animation was breathtaking, the characters, great as always. Toy Story 3 is much better than Toy Story 2, which was still a hell of a sequel. This was a well-done, fitting end to the series. Well done, once again, Pixar.	2
2266	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	I must watch again	2
2267	Inception	It's simply one of the best heist films ever. Certainly the best looking. One of those films to be seen twice. Don't expect it to be a psychological film, it doesn't try to be one. 	2
2268	It Follows	Criticker expected scores are not usually far off, but ugg this time?!  do NOT see this movie   	0

2274	Hero	Absolutely amazing camera! Wow	2
2275	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	Well now, I've just matured twenty years.  Regrettably, I've never seen any of Clint's, or any other in this genre before. It's witty, humorous and very well directed, though that's seemingly credited to Leone.  There were many scenes that others may have deemed slow and unnecessary, but I feel that the emotion portrayed through the silence created an effect that no scripted dialog could ever have. 	2
2276	Hero	What a moving story that was shot beautifully and aesthetically pleasing. A bit slow at times, but it had definitely a great story.	2
2277	The Man from Earth	I didn't like everything about this movie but the premise is very interesting. if it was made in the '60s , this film would have been a classic. It would also work better as a play I think.	2
2278	The Bridge	Definitely one of the saddest films ever made. Although I kind of knew what would happen to the boys, it was shocking.	0
2279	Man on the Moon	A surprisingly very well-done biopic, and Jim Carrey does an excellent job altogether at breathing life back into Kaufman.	2
2280	Recep Ivedik	güldüm mü? evet ama neden animsamiyorum... 	1
2281	The Passenger	Being cornered by one's own life and, then, in escape, being unable to free oneself from the inexorable shackles. A tale of freedom and self-worth. The final tracking shot is, of course, incredible.	2
2282	Hero	Absolutely amazing camera! Wow	2

2287	Man on the Moon	A surprisingly very well-done biopic, and Jim Carrey does an excellent job altogether at breathing life back into Kaufman.	2
2288	The Secret Life of Walter Mitty	The cast understands their characters well, especially Stiller, who seems to be going on a journey himself in Walter Mitty. He's always been a unique comedic voice at his best, or at least boldest. After this film, however, I'm curious to see where he'll take us next, and what type of movie we can expect out of him. Hopefully, it'll be something like this, where we don't know what to expect.	2
2289	Brother	bad ass movie except the black dude can't fuckin act. kitano's style at its best	0
2290	There Will Be Blood	One of my friends saw the first 2/3rds of the movie.  He's lucky.  The ending stinks and everything that was interesting in the beginning fizzled by the end.  Yes the movie is visually stunning.  And yes it feels like you're really in a turn-of-the-century oil boom.  But I don't want to waste my time watching some miserable psychopath ruin his and other's lives.  I don't gain anything useful knowledge, personal insight, or new perspectives, as I would in an actually good drama.	0
2291	Deep Impact	Much more realistic portrayal of events surrounding a cometary impact.  Gets a little (or a lot) sappy in places.  Vastly better than the other meteor movie that year	2
2292	Chinatown	As much as I admire the work of both (Roman) Polanski and (Jack) Nicholson, I found Chinatown tedious from beginning to just before the end. 	2
2293	Diabolique	The main reason I go out of my way to look for Criterion movies. This pre-'60s Gothic classic has one of the greatest twist endings in the history of cinema. Like The Wages of Fear, it does take some time to get going, but once it's built up some momentum you'll be astonished at the amount of vintage suspense that this film packs.	2
2294	The Farewell	A well-crafted, restrained film that is never quite sentimental, but instead moves by how deftly it shows the texture of family bonds.	2
2295	Inglourious Basterds	I don't claim to know a lot about history, but I don't think that's what happened.	1
2296	Who Killed Captain Alex?	Had a legitimately great time watching this. VJ Emmie is a hell of a hypeman.	2
2297	Recep Ivedik	güldüm mü? evet ama neden animsamiyorum... 	1
2298	The Passenger	Being cornered by one's own life and, then, in escape, being unable to free oneself from the inexorable shackles. A tale of freedom and self-worth. The final tracking shot is, of course, incredible.	2
2299	Mad Max: Fury Road	Film of the year?  Probably.  	1
2300	Brother	bad ass movie except the black dude can't fuckin act. kitano's style at its best	0
2301	Be Kind Rewind	Danny Glover and Jack Black lol	1
2302	Gangs of New York	Far too long. Far too long. Far too long! Daniel Day-Lewis was awesome though. 	1
2303	Mr. Holland's Opus	A great movie about the value of art and music.   It also delves into relationships and what people mean to each other and how we can take each other for granted.	2
2304	Closer	I really liked the straightforward tone of the film and the fact that you really get a good insight in just 4 characters and their ideas about love, relationships and sex. A very daring and intriguing film.	2
2305	Mad Max: Fury Road	vrooooomm vrooooooom 	1
2306	Inglourious Basterds	I think this is a great movie if you take it for what it is. A lot of people have criticised the characters, I think they were perfect for what was trying to be accomplished with this film. It was entertaining, not an epic film, not a serious film, obviously not an accurate film. It was a superficial potryal for the people. an entertaining exploit.	0
2307	Citizen Kane	# 1	1
2308	Postal	titties YAY, dick boo, dudes kissing more boo	1
2309	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	Sci Fi at its best!	2
2310	The Devils	Like Mad Max for 17th century France. Instead of ozploitation, this is plaguesploitation. Catholicsploitation. A furious movie of burning bodies, nuns masturbating with a a crucified Christ's nailed hands, and fantasies of sexually licking his wounds. I have yet to find a torture porn/violence porn with so much heart, such honest anger. Forget The Last Temptation of Christ or The Passion of the Christ: The Devils is the only one whose controversy is understandable. A Must watch. An experience. 	0
2311	A Simple Favor	The tone changes wildly throughout the movie, going from a very striking mysterious feel, to cheesy & goofy. The movie was very enjoyable and the plot held up. 	2
2312	Titanic: The Animated Movie	Hilariously bad. The animation is incredibly amateurish; frankly, half the stuff on Newgrounds is better. They apparently traced animation from other, better movies, and perhaps this is why it features characters lifted from 101 Dalmatians, Cinderella, and An American Tail, among others. The dialogue is terribly written and poorly dubbed, and the few songs in it are both terrible and pointless, and the plot makes no goddamned sense. And of course, let's not forget the RAPPING DOG.	0
2313	Apocalypse Now	Overrated! Overrated, overrated, overrated. And did I mention, overrated? I know--heresy, right? But I disliked Heart of Darkness, and I dislike this. Who cares about high-budget helicopter ambush shots? IMO: masterful portrayal of war means stark realism, not Coppola bravado. Watch Platoon instead.	2
2314	Trainspotting	scottish drug epic. if you have watched this, you would have wanted more of it.	1
2315	Drive	A pretty lame, predictable story, wrapped in a remarkably meticulous recreation of the '80s L.A.-Noir genre. In other words, incredibly tedious. Ryan Gosling stayed very true to that theme, and thus discovered nothing of his character's humanity. Carey Mulligan rose above it, and her character is the one interesting thing in the entire movie, but it's nowhere near enough to save it.	0
2316	Primeval	...while the real Gustave may have racked up 300 odd kills, this film is surely an even bigger, badder killer -- of brain cells.	0
2317	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Best Steven Spielberg film.	2
2318	Inception	Probably the most mind-blowing storytelling movie-experience I can remember having.	2
2319	Her	"My whole review is just to mention that one shot of him, dejected, in front of a screen with an eagle on it. It's been seared onto my brain.
 "	0
2320	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	Clever and profound.	2
2321	Be Kind Rewind	Disappointing. Great idea though	2
2322	Melancholia	I've had enough of von Trier's sick hallucinations, really. Especially when they are empty and pretentious. The constantly shaking camera does not make this movie beautiful, on the contrary. Beautiful things don't make me wanna puke all the time.	0
2323	The Fifth Element	Chris Tucker isn't a blackman according to black people.	1
2324	Eyes Wide Shut	Kubrick's last film is a flawed but interesting look at one hell of a relationship.	2
2325	Rules of Engagement	What is more important? Pride of Vietnam veteran or lives of innocent women and children? This film gives a straight answer, but goes even further: there is no such thing as innocent MUSLIM woman, child, dog, etc. All Muslim children are given AK47 at the birth, right? They learn to shoot at age, say, one. Right? What is the moral of the story? Every Muslim have to be killed. Some kind of collective guilt. God bless motherfucking America.	0
2326	Aquaman	The camerawork was pretty nice. The VFX was ok too.	2
2327	The Town	Ben Affleck's accent in this movie reminded me of Adam Sandler.	1
2328	Apocalypse Now	Overrated! Overrated, overrated, overrated. And did I mention, overrated? I know--heresy, right? But I disliked Heart of Darkness, and I dislike this. Who cares about high-budget helicopter ambush shots? IMO: masterful portrayal of war means stark realism, not Coppola bravado. Watch Platoon instead.	2
2329	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Snnnooooooze....A.I., AGONIZINGLY INANE!	0
2330	Contact	One of the best contemporary movies of its genre, with an interesting premise and execution. The idea behind the alien contact through radio transmissions isn't precisely new, but the way it was written for this movie amazed me. Science vs. religion is a touchy subject for some people, and in certain way that view was favored in the film, by leaving the most important part of the movie (the actual aliens) to mere faith, which probably doomed it. At least I'm open to the idea, unlike others...	2
2331	Rampage	Good movie. Pacing was excellent. Just enough explosions amd action scenes, funny bits, conversations and light-hearted moments. The Rock and his bond with primates is lovable and warm to see. Lot of violence towards animals in this movie though, so people sensitive to that should take care. 	2
2332	Flatliners	"Interesting premise.
 Not-so-captivating movie."	2
2333	The Color Purple	Not really a lot for me, a white guy, to identify with here.  I liked Oprah though.  Everything you do!	1
2334	Lost in Space	Yuck.  How could you mess up space... space is so cool.	0
2335	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	Clever and profound.	2
2336	Be Kind Rewind	Disappointing. Great idea though	2
2337	Melancholia	I've had enough of von Trier's sick hallucinations, really. Especially when they are empty and pretentious. The constantly shaking camera does not make this movie beautiful, on the contrary. Beautiful things don't make me wanna puke all the time.	0
2338	The Fifth Element	Chris Tucker isn't a blackman according to black people.	1
2339	Eyes Wide Shut	Kubrick's last film is a flawed but interesting look at one hell of a relationship.	2
2340	Howl's Moving Castle	Thought this was one of his messier films. 	1
2341	Hackers	Even less realistic than The Net or Swordfish.  However, there's something about the cyberpunk atmosphere and the overall casualness of the movie that makes it fun to watch.	0
2342	Contact	One of the best contemporary movies of its genre, with an interesting premise and execution. The idea behind the alien contact through radio transmissions isn't precisely new, but the way it was written for this movie amazed me. Science vs. religion is a touchy subject for some people, and in certain way that view was favored in the film, by leaving the most important part of the movie (the actual aliens) to mere faith, which probably doomed it. At least I'm open to the idea, unlike others...	2
2343	Rampage	Good movie. Pacing was excellent. Just enough explosions amd action scenes, funny bits, conversations and light-hearted moments. The Rock and his bond with primates is lovable and warm to see. Lot of violence towards animals in this movie though, so people sensitive to that should take care. 	2
2344	Flatliners	"Interesting premise.
 Not-so-captivating movie."	2
2345	The Color Purple	Not really a lot for me, a white guy, to identify with here.  I liked Oprah though.  Everything you do!	1

2349	Melancholia	I've had enough of von Trier's sick hallucinations, really. Especially when they are empty and pretentious. The constantly shaking camera does not make this movie beautiful, on the contrary. Beautiful things don't make me wanna puke all the time.	0
2350	Dredd	"Keeping it tight. Dredd is a simple, tightly edited and beautiful movie. It's either very mean or very funny, with a nice subtext and completely unlikable main characters. I love them.

The plot is straightforward, the movie operates mostly by show don't tell basis, camera angles make the block a major character (it pays homage to Alien in camera movement!) and the action is beautiful. 

Not larger than life, but a very solid, entertaining movie with a good artistic vision"	2
2351	First Reformed	Paul Schrader is back in top form here, his first legitimately great film since possibly Affliction. Ethan Hawke gives an extraordinary performance that made me re-evaluate the actor entirely, as I wasn't much of a fan of his before this. The ending may bother some, but I find it to be thought-provoking and haunting. This one really sneaks up on you. A great film.	2
2352	Knowing	Nicolas Cage and his doll hair perform a gross parody of what we humans call acting in this dumb, dumb, dumb flick.	0
2353	Alexander	if I could give this a negative score, I would. Stone manages to systematically destroy anything interesting about the Alexander Story	0
2354	Message from Space	Toei's response to Star Wars is confusing and boring.  A mish-mash of influences, with a special effects menu reminiscent of the 1970's Godzilla films, but with an incomprehensible plot that borders on the unintentionally funny.  Sadly, not bad enough to be good.  	1
2355	Inglourious Basterds	Tarantino needs a good editor to leave his films to when he is done shooting,and someone who can help him get off his over blown ego.This movie,despite a couple of well shot action scenes,it's unbearably pretentious with all this inner joke CRAP and oh so smart self awareness.Tarantino also needs to STOP making all the characters in his films(despite their backgrounds,age,professions ecc.) talk and act like the same person = his own coked-up alter ego.Tarantino needs to fucking shut up already. 	0
2356	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	Sci Fi at its best!	2
2357	Lars and the Real Girl	I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie; to be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  However, I fell in love with the sincerity of the main character and the sympathy of the town.  It was endearing without drifting too far into the soppy.  	1
2358	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button	Whilst there are some incredibly beautiful camera work and lighting in this film, overall I found it quite unengaging, the script is predictable and overly-sentimental and the central character is very two-dimensional. I also found the extreme similarities with Forrest Gump (which had the same screenwriter) quite off-putting. 	1
2359	Repo Man	John Wayne was a fag.	1
2360	Juno	Disliked it intensely. The dialog was stilted and unnatural, and the characters were annoying. Jason Bateman's character was made out to be a horrible bastard because he wanted to pursue his dream. Let's hope Diablo Cody goes back to stripping for hipster cred. 	1
2361	Bratz: The Movie	A lot of people don't like to slam kiddie movies. But, this shit is ruining America. 	2
2362	Predestination	Go f**k yourself, Ethan Hawke!	0
2363	Two Thousand Maniacs!	If you consider southerners to be a race, this is the most racist movie ever.	0
2364	Dark Days	One of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and a pretty kickass soundtrack by DJ Shadow. It's a look into the life of people who otherwise are considered nonexistant by society. Pretty uplifiting, as they're eventually given help in their situation. An example of a documentary that brings not only awareness to a situation, but also is instrumental in helping. 	2
2365	The Nightmare Before Christmas	I love the animation in this movie.  Truly brilliant!	2
2366	The Commuter	Not as clever as it thinks it is or as thrilling as it wants to be, The Commuter (aka Taken Lite) simply comes and goes like a common locomotive. While there will always be an audience for such popcorn fare, this seems like an opportunity missed as a visibly weary Liam Neeson spends much of his ill-fated commute trying to avoid conflict rather than welcome it with clenched fists. Looking every bit his 65 years, it might be time for the once spritely Neeson to hand in his reluctant-hero badge.	0
2367	Waking Life	"Waking Life
The biggest weakness of Waking Life is is that it is less clever than it thinks it is. The film is essentially a long string of speeches supposed to expose you to interesting ideas. Unfortunately most of the ideas are either not that interesting or not that well put."	0
2368	Stalker	I respect it for being the inspiration to one of my favorite video games and it has got some amazing cinematography, scenery and photography. But I'm sorry this was just too friggin' boring and I see no reason for it to stretch out for nearly 3 hours. Also the dialogue mostly consists of very heavy handed and inaccessible philosophy and talk of danger that never manifests itself. I will most likely never watch it again	0
2369	Planet Terror	Not my cup of te...er blood. Brutal, corny, slowish and repetitive. If the makers are aware that they are making a bad movie, it still does not a good movie make.	0
2370	Ratatouille	What a wonderful movie. Great design of all the characters. Their physical and facial gestures show us that Ratatouille doesn't need to be full of dialogues to tell us this rich story about the search for indentity. Brad Bird even makes room for a little bit of social criticism (Gusteau's burritos, chinese food and hot dogs coming soon, xD). Thank god, Pixar still knows how to make great films. Films for both children and adults.	2
2371	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	Ultimate facepalm moment: two hours of film musings on how it is not good to be a vampire and the moral dilemmas and intense pain of having to be inhuman to survive, then return to present where eager american journalist misses the entire point and is all COOL WHERE DO I SIGN. *headdesk*	0
2372	K-PAX	It is a rip-off of Hombre mirando al sudeste (Man looking to the south east), an Argentinean movie made ten years earlier (and without paying copyright)	0
2373	Willard	Disappointing, I expected something far more original and captivating. Instead I've seen something that could as well be a movie for children if it wasn't for the sad ending and one killing scene, and the death of the mother. But really it was nothing special according to me, a social misfit getting revenge is nothing new.	0
2374	The Thing	Great story and effects.	2
2375	3 Days of the Condor	I'm thoroughly confused. Not about the cloak-and-dagger plot of international intrigue, but about why Faye Dunaway fell in love with Robert Redford. Completely ridiculous. Credibility was lost right then and there.	0
2376	The Battle of Algiers	An engaging film on the NLF's struggle for independence in Algeria during the 1950s. A classic and must-see for students of insurgencies and irregular warfare.	2
2377	Electrocuting an Elephant	This is something terrible but hard to look away from. The event on it's own was pretty rotten but to learn that Edison orchestrated the whole thing as a tool in a smear campaign against Nikola Tesla makes it even worse to watch.	0
2378	Waterworld	Why all the hate? It's a good adventure movie with some cool action scenes and crazy characters.	1
2379	Zeitgeist: The Movie	The whole part about Jesus comparing with Horus and other gods is just pure lies. They may not did it on purpose, but if you do a documentary, you have to check everything you say very carefully. I haven't watch the rest of the movie, because if you lie about one thing, you can't expect people to believe you about other things. Lying is the worst possible thing a documentary can do. And I am not an offended believer, I am open minded atheist. 	1
2380	Illustrious Corpses	Great performance of Lino Ventura.	2
2381	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	I couldn't find any reason to like or care about the characters in this film.  Aside from a few interesting ideas, this was a terrible movie!	0
2382	Enter the Void	I 'Entered the Void' at TIFF09 and came out the other end dazzled and dazed.	0
2383	The Tree of Life	The most pretentious drinking game. Sip everytime the sun is shown through the trees.	0
2384	Orca: The Killer Whale	Man, you gotta see this movie! It's got a whale miscarriage and everything!	1
2385	Cloverfield	why didn't they try some angles with the camera on a rope swinging over someone's head, too?	0
2386	Into the Wild	I LIKED WHEN THE PLANT KILLED THE PRICK	1

2390	The Loved Ones	Grossly underrated horror film. The suspense is right up where it needs to be, and the makers of this film know their audience. The camera knows when the threat of terrible things is enough to get us on the edge of our seats, when to cut away from the horrible, and when it's absolutely necessary to show everything and lay the cards on the table. Our  female lead is insane and scary on a level I have not seen since Kathy Bates in misery. Absolutely delightful.	2
2391	Hot Rod	I been drinkin Green Tea all god damn day!   Danny McBride is the Greatest actor of our generation.	2
2392	Manos: The Hands of Fate	one of the worst movies ever made...and that's what makes it so great. I can't imagine sitting through it without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew there to comment on it.	0
2393	Mission: Impossible 2	ghdfghdfgh	1
2394	National Treasure	While piecing together bits from early American history, this film is an enjoyable action flick that does not take itself too seriously, and never forgets that it is a lighthearted, just-for-fun action/adventure movie.	2
2395	Man on Fire	At no point did Denzel Washingotn set on fire. Disappointing.	1
2396	3 from Hell	I guess I'm finally too old for this shit.	1
2397	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	This was highly misogynist and too brusque. It has The Straw Man fallacy, yet the memorable actress Louise Fletcher playing Nurse Ratched was not the monster I expected after hearing the worst. This may mean that people have simply become crueler, & that Nurse Ratched in the classic film now could only stand for a tepid bureaucracy.	1
2398	Caligula	I love it, you don't. Big fucking deal. 	2
2399	Winter's Bone	This movie is all types of Ozark badass.  The film keeps things tense without causing fatigue.  Things go bad, but not so bad that you want to stop watching.  The Dollys are not to be fucked with.	1
2400	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	what a load of crap	0
2401	The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep	"Normally I would not write anything about this, but given it was as bad as it was, I must. For the sake of others :) 
If you: 1)like good plot, 2)good acting, 3)good special effects, 4)well written dialogues, 5)well constructed scenes, 6)a followable line of thought, 7)intelligently made fairy tale, then DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is anything but. I'm exaggerating, but just a bit. Good side to the film: they speak Scottish. Well done."	2

2414	Stranger Things	Bland as hell 80s-revival-core for nostalgia-babies and non-fans of the genres it belongs to. Runs through every cliche happily with very little variation or any characterization. 	1
2415	Juno	Disliked it intensely. The dialog was stilted and unnatural, and the characters were annoying. Jason Bateman's character was made out to be a horrible bastard because he wanted to pursue his dream. Let's hope Diablo Cody goes back to stripping for hipster cred. 	1

2421	The Godfather	vut	1
2422	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	This, while very similar to A New Hope, was a brilliant rejuvination of what Star Wars is meant to be. (Standout perfomances by Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver)	2
2423	Venom	Tom Hardy!	1
2424	Her	little different, but also not extremely good, but nothing to learn	0
2425	L.A. Confidential	"Suspense, interesting characters and oooh, a twist... 
My kind of movie!"	2
2426	Willow	72.5	1
2427	Whiplash	You don't need to be a jazz lover to love this movie. This movie is about struggle, passion, and self confidence. The plot is so good, the sound, the cinematography, the performance (especially the 'not quite my tempo' guy) is so great. Love the crash scene, so thrilling. Love the catchphrase, memorable.	2
2428	The Fall	Amazing effects. Visually the movie is astounding. Love the story. The little girl in this movie really takes the cake though. She is probably 7 or 8 years old and she is amazing. She cracks me up. 	2
2429	Ex Machina	As you watch Ex Machina, you begin to get a sickening feeling, and slowly, you feel your stomach drop.  The tension builds to an unbearable place, and although some parts are a drag, Ex Machina successfully pulls off what it was trying to do while leaving a bitter aftertaste as well.	2
2430	Ex Machina	Garland's direction is incredible just for the fact that he completely commands what is shown on screen with such finesse and confidence.	2
2431	The Martian	Excellent	2
2432	What We Do in the Shadows	A dry look at what (semi-)eternal life would be like.  Death is approached with a laughable lightness in this dark comedy.  The acting is solid but the writing really makes this film a must-see.  It's a reminder that even if you are a non-human, you can still suffer from the daily doldrum of the human condition.  But the most refreshing moral is that even two groups who vehemently hate one another can get along if they've got a common bond.  Sometimes that bond's name is Stu.	2
2433	Kubo and the Two Strings	Kubo & The Two Strings both brings an interesting adventure tale to life, but also breathes a bittersweet message into a world of children's films that exist to entertain and not to teach or to instill values. Kubo and the Two Strings is not a film to put on to keep the kids busy whilst you cook dinner in a rush, it is one to be watched with them, learning alongside them, holding the youngest in your arms as this film delivers a deep, heartfelt & touching message in a gentle, understandable way.	2
2434	Léon: The Professional	Being a professional assassin is easy. Being a professional farter is much more rewarding.	2
2435	Memento	a brilliant mindbender	2
2436	No Country for Old Men	Excellent. The ending is off putting for some, I was originally puzzled by it, but the more I think about this movie, the more it makes sense.	1
2437	Interstellar	http://cinemuckblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/interstellar-2014/	1
2438	The Double	I cared about the non existant!	0
2439	Shaun of the Dead	I find it simply amazing that horror and comedy can manage to work together and independently as well. It's not just a fun zombie flick, it has a much more classic level that we can base many zombie films on. I've often thought that we can compare this to real life considering the technology revolution, but, besides that, you'll still be able to scream one time and laugh the next, and maybe even at the same time.	2
2440	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	I don't get what people like so much about this film, it has some great jokes like You can't fight in here! This is the war room! But other than that it just doesn't have enough humor for the film duration. Boring film for me.	0
2441	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	A movie drowning in negative emotions and almost completely devoid of positive ones, it features masterful tonal shifts and forces the audience to empathize in ways they'd rather not.	0
2442	Shaun of the Dead	I find it simply amazing that horror and comedy can manage to work together and independently as well.

2443	Train to Busan	Yes, another zombie movie BUT & it is meant to be a big but-done well - NB is a serious zombie flic not a wacky, funny one. The zombies are remorseless & like a human tidal wave. The necessary claustrophobic locale is justifiable. There are people under pressure with betrayals & character changes forced by the situational pressure. A few soppy bits but they don't undermine the overall quality. Good suspense. If you like the genre-a must see, for others - give it a try, it's quite entertaining.	1
2444	Four Lions	Relies a bit heavily on the stupidity of some of the characters, but is quite funny.	0
2445	Drive	Very well made. 	2
2446	Blindspotting	It's an utterly exceptional film to tackle the weighty themes it does while remaining so fantastically entertaining.   Seex 3x	2
2447	The Martian	Good. In its essence a Robinson Crusoe-esque story, but It does bring in too many secondary characters in my opinion. It takes the focus away from Watney's problems and the sense of loneliness he probably would have had. The film doesn't address this enough. Still, I had fun watching it. It kept me engaged throughout, although it often felt the need to science it up. At first I kind of liked that, but it got old quick. The music could have had a better use than comedic relief.	2
2448	Drive	Enjoyment: 9/10, Plot: 7/10 Themes: 8/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Direction: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Writing: 8/10 Score: 10/10 Editing: 8/10 Design: 8/10	2
2449	Captain Marvel	I loved the plot and the delivery on the cast's part. Also it was amazing to see young Fury and young Coulson (even if their appearance was basically only there for fan-service). Also Goose is the best character in the entire MCU I will not change my mind.	2
2450	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Probably the definitive adventure movie.	2
2451	A Cure for Wellness	I was so excited for this movie for months and hate to say I was pretty disappointed. It is such a beautiful film in terms of location and set, but lord have mercy there are too many loose ends. There are more questions than answers and not in a good way; more like I'm questioning how certain things were supposed to connect and why others were in there at all. The film had such potential to be thrilling and gripping but missed the mark by quite a bit.	0
2452	Ex Machina	Well written, perfectly tuned for mood & atmosphere, and the performances selling it all for one of the most over looked films of 2015	2
2453	The Animal	cleaver idea. Love the actor.	2
2454	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Yup, it's another star wars movie. At least it distracted JJ for a bit.	1
2455	Neighbors	Y'know, I really like Zach Efron. I think he's very good. The rest of the movie doesn't do much. You'll maybe laugh once or twice-- four times if you're really into it. Regardless, I don't highly recommend this one, it's just there.	0
2456	Captain Marvel	I loved the plot and the delivery on the cast's part. Also it was amazing to see young Fury and young Coulson (even if their appearance was basically only there for fan-service). Also Goose is the best character in the entire MCU I will not change my mind.	2
2457	V for Vendetta	The CGI'd up action scenes leave me cold and the politics of the film are juvenile. 	1
2458	20,000 Leagues Under the Sea	A very interesting, enjoyable adaptation.  Disney put a lot of money in this film, and it shows: gorgeous sets, especially the Nautilus, and pretty good effects for the time.  James Mason's intense performance as the urbane yet tortured Captain Nemo walks away (or should I say sails away?) with this movie, but Kirk Douglas's energy and Peter Lorre's... whatever-it-is keep the Mason-less scenes alive.	2
2459	Mission: Impossible III	JJ Abrams knows what he's doing, at least within the summer blockbuster framework but I think the film is just not good enough. 	0
2460	The Departed	This film ostensibly takes place in Boston, yet I don't think I saw a single garage tattoo or pregnant teenager in the entire movie. The characters are clean, articulate, and entirely too creative with their vulgarity. As a Boston movie, Casey Affleck's older brother's Gone Baby Gone hits closer to reality. But as a Boston gangster fantasy, the kind that gets white Americans excited about their remote Irish heritage and distant relation to Whitey Bulger, it's absolutely sensational.	2
2461	The Martian	When (if) he comes back we should duct-tape him to the ground just to see how he laughs his way back to space. 	0
2462	The Incredibles	The Incredibles is quite possibly my favorite animated movie.  Maybe it's not as groundbreaking as early Pixar films, as poignant as Miyazaki's movies, or as important as something like Wall-E, but The Incredibles has well developed characters, sharp humor, great pacing, and thrilling action sequences.  Beyond being a great animated film, The Incredibles is a fantastic adventure story.  On top of it all, it's easy to empathize with the characters who yearn for lost youth.  See this movie!	2
2463	The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie	Hell yes I'm a goofy goober. I saw this long after I was too old to be watching Spongebob, but I still found it pretty hilarious.	2
2464	Watchmen	really cool	2
2465	V for Vendetta	The CGI'd up action scenes leave me cold and the politics of the film are juvenile. 	1
2466	20,000 Leagues Under the Sea	A very interesting, enjoyable adaptation.

2468	Ex Machina	Not only is this film visually stunning, suspenseful, beyond exciting, mind-bending, and almost perfectly acted, it's also...shit, I didn't leave anything to put here. Well, it's fucking fantastic. Amazing performances by Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander propped up a weak performance by Domhnall Gleeson in a sci-fi suspense film that keeps you guessing all the time. If you weren't scared of Artificial Intelligence before watching this film, you are now.	2
2469	The Rocketeer	Worth it for a young Jennifer Connelly and a cracking performance by Timothy Dalton of the over the top arch villian, A real hoot. 	2
2470	The Rocketeer	Worth it for a young Jennifer Connelly and a cracking performance by Timothy Dalton of the over the top arch villian, A real hoot. 	2
2471	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Perfect.  Lucas/Spielberg's best collaboration	2
2472	Lost Highway	Exists halfway between reality and a nightmare. Uneasy erotic scenes and a truly disturbing 'mystery man' chill you to the bone. Deeply unsettling, makes your knees weak and gives you butterflies. Fantastic.	0
2473	Young Frankenstein	A classic comedy and one of the most brilliant spoofs of all time.  It doesn't overdo it and provides each gag with its own, bravura laugh.	2
2474	Religulous	You need to watch this if you want to know just how stupid people are; frightful and entertaining. 	0
2475	The Thing	Very....Very....Very....Good Movie...	2
2476	Angel Heart	mickey rourke was hot, i would love to have a date with that guy	1
2477	Deadpool	"It was pretty much everything it promised it would be. Flimsy origin story, and weak bad guy, but it was still a great time to watch.
"	2
2478	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Düpedüz bir reboot bölümü olan The Force Awakens'dan daha iyi. Biraz klasik takılsalardı daha çok keyif alabilirdim yine de. (Mesela açılış roll'ü yoktu, eski müzikler çok az kullanılıyor vs.) Memnunum gördüğümden.	2
2479	The Matrix	The only incredible film from the Matrix trilogy. Awesome storyline, great action, a nerd's dream. Seemingly deep in symbolism, it shows just how great these guys can write a story when they put their minds to it (although admittedly it was very much like Dark City)	2

2481	The Matrix	The only incredible film from the Matrix trilogy. Awesome storyline, great action, a nerd's dream. Seemingly deep in symbolism, it shows just how great these guys can write a story when they put their minds to it (although admittedly it was very much like Dark City)	2
2482	The Revenant	Incredibly gorgeous film-making about a vengeful tale out on the beastly, unforgiving American Frontier; Hardy is ruthless & DiCaprio's commitment is miraculous, delivering a mortally uncompromising, nearly wordless performance. An extraordinary cinematic experience that's unhampered & punishable yet worth every drop of blood. 	2
2483	District 9	Brilliantly executed.	2
2484	The Room	Words cannot describe how brilliant this film is. Godard, Tarantino, De Palma; all idiots. Wiseau is truly my generation's first visionary.	2
2485	Shaun of the Dead	Love these guys.  This film is a classic.  Hilarious and fun.	2
2486	The Unbearable Lightness of Being	Il libro e' molto superiore qualitativamente; un film un po' anonimo e lento, ma che si guarda volentieri.	0
2487	Ex Machina	A terrible ending. very disappointing. Oscar Isaac was a  shining star, though.	0
2488	Hero	Art Direction is simply phenomenal.	2
2489	Carlito's Way	Best Pacino's role ever!	2
2490	Shaun of the Dead	Love these guys.  This film is a classic.  Hilarious and fun.	2
2491	Ex Machina	A terrible ending. very disappointing. Oscar Isaac was a  shining star, though.	0
2492	Carlito's Way	Best Pacino's role ever!	2
2493	Home Alone	A perfect family movie. I grew up with it. MY entire family would enjoy watching it too.	2
2494	Hero	Art Direction is simply phenomenal.	2
2495	No Country for Old Men	It's been too long since I've seen a film that knew exactly how to toy with me and keep me from guessing what was going to happen next, even though I knew the basic plot points. 	0
2496	Apollo 13	For a tech lover, this is awe inspiring.  The beautiful machines and extremely well-done CGI of the launch bring copious tears to these nerdy eyes.  The emotions of the characters were also well expressed.    Hanks, who is always good, did especially well with his role here as he is a big fan of space travel and a closet astronaut.  He also helped with the writing of this movie, which is probably why this is Ron's best.  But, Ron did make some characters look more like idiots than they were.	1
2497	The Blind Side	This movie was made to appeal to idiots. And the creators knew what they were doing.	0
2498	Infernal Affairs II	a pointless prequel that was probably made just to make money off infernal affairs which was a great movie	0
2499	Shaun of the Dead	Fantastic. Loved the early scenes with the carnage happening in the background with Shaun blissfully unaware. The end was a little deus ex machina, but Yvonne showing up randomly was foreshadowed and his party meeting up with hers was easy to consider as how far the joke would go. Again, fantastic movie.	2
2500	Shaun of the Dead	Fantastic. Loved the early scenes with the carnage happening in the background with Shaun blissfully unaware. The end was a little deus ex machina, but Yvonne showing up randomly was foreshadowed and his party meeting up with hers was easy to consider as how far the joke would go. Again, fantastic movie.	2
2501	Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed	I can't believe I'm admitting that I watched this.	2
2502	City of God	Like being hit by a semi-truck - this is the most exhilarating experience you can have in film. Cannot recommend this movie highly enough!!!	0
2503	Drive	One of the few movies I consider perfect.	2
2504	Whiplash	A wonderful, musical ride with great direction. The only fault was in the story being a little cliche.	2
2505	Ex Machina	This movie relied heavily on it's beautiful scenery and hot robots. I enjoyed the subtle tension throughout however I couldn't say I was very entertained. Predictable story line and pretentious dialogue.	2
2506	Hereditary	A very unsettling psychological horror. The movie creates a building tension that climaxes in the most WTF way that I've seen in some time. People could not keep their laughter at the absurd elements of the film. There is too much in the movie to really grasp in one viewing. Toni Collette is incredible as an achingly haunted woman who is desperately clinging to her family as they all plunge towards surreality. It doesn't frighten you with scares but it disturbs you from the inside.	1
2507	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	Everything that is great about cinema can be found here, and it is glorious.	2
2508	The Notebook	Great love story, would've been better with somebody other than rachel mcadams	2
2509	The Thing	One of the absolute best horror films of all, intellectual and bloody at the same time, with the real fear being paranoia of each other. Let's pray they never decide to remake this gem.	2
2510	The Notebook	Great love story, would've been better with somebody other than rachel mcadams	2
2511	The Thing	One of the absolute best horror films of all, intellectual and bloody at the same time, with the real fear being paranoia of each other. Let's pray they never decide to remake this gem.	2
2512	It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia	I don't think there is a show that makes me laugh harder on a more consistent basis than this one. God Bless Frank Reynolds. 	2
2513	Rear Window	Its interesting how Jeff (the main character) interprets the observations he witnesses. Its all a case of context, I suppose. Hearing him query other peoples interpretations of what he saw made me doubt the truth behind the circumstances. It features a strong performance from both James Stewart and Grace Kelly, who is quick to challenge his assumptions. It makes me wonder what do others read in to otherwise seemingly every day activities and observations?.	1
2514	Troy	Very good movie.  Brad Pitt does an excellent job as the half-god Achilles.  Eric Bana is equally impressive as the mighty Hector and Peter O'Toole is esquisite as the Trojan king Priam.  The fighting scenes are excellent, and there is a wonderful plot here.  This is the kind of movie 300 could have been, if it had more than fighting in it.	2
2515	Fantastic Mr. Fox	had to tie a handkerchief round my jaw in order to keep it closed. Feels as if my eyes got laid. 	1
2516	Gravity	Sublime, life-affirming IMAX 3D experience. Never felt THIS close to being in space before!	2
2517	The Witch	That feeling between I am fine and I am having an anxiety attack in movie form.	0
2518	My Neighbor Totoro	weird and nice stuffs happen in this movie.	1
2519	Pacific Rim	the characters are uninteresting and dialogues are mostly bad, but then again, who gives a shit? This movie knows what it has to do and it does it very well.	0
2520	40 Days and 40 Nights	Do you remember the boob-field dream sequence....? Unfortunately i do.	0
2521	This Is Spinal Tap	First saw it as a teenager and loved it but started loving it even more as I got older and the more you know about the escapades of rock bands the funnier it gets.  Chris Guest is a huge talent and I wish he had done more early on.  David St Hubbins letting Nigel Tufnel come on stage for a gig after he' s left the band is so close to home.	1
2522	How the Grinch Stole Christmas	There is a Grinch, and he steals Christmas, but that's where the similarities end.  The Whos down in Whoville are opposite from how Seuss portrayed them, and the original moral (Christmas not being about material goods) is replaced with You shouldn't be mean to people just because they're different.  'Cause that's only moral allowed in children's movies nowadays.	0
2523	Nacho Libre	Quite surprisingly a great film!	2
2524	47 Meters Down	How to sabotage an otherwise great movie with a terrible ending.	2
2525	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	How did they manage to make Kylo Ren look so cool but be so much more annoying than Anakin. Fucking hell. 	0
2526	Young Frankenstein	My personal favorite Brooks film, simply because it respects the audience a little bit more than usual and doesn't smash them in the face with wackiness. Sure it's wacky, but it's balanced with with the right amount of subtlety. If only he'd used this approach more often.	2
2527	Le Samouraï	With respect to its speechlessness ,but get tired of  irritating rhythm and very ordinary story, telling nothing.	0
2528	Rear Window	Great cinematography and suspense, and, really, the setting for this movie is so interesting and well set up that it just makes looking at it so enjoyable. 	2
2529	Woman in the Dunes	#630	1
2530	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Good by measure of production values, but lacks greatly in spirit, very uninspired film. Characters lack of charisma is disturbing, only the main character is good.	1
2531	Gravity	Sublime, life-affirming IMAX 3D experience. Never felt THIS close to being in space before!	2
2532	The Witch	That feeling between I am fine and I am having an anxiety attack in movie form.	0

2534	Pacific Rim	the characters are uninteresting and dialogues are mostly bad, but then again, who gives a shit? This movie knows what it has to do and it does it very well.	0
2535	Encounters at the End of the World	Very different look at different people who crave different things. We need more of these folk.	2
2536	Bratz: The Movie	A very intelligent movie filled with smart dialogue and deep meaning. 	2
2537	Big Girls Don't Cry	the movie spirals into the depths of near plausible depression, and it is probably one of the best and oddest girl bonding movies i've ever seen. 	2
2538	Shaun of the Dead	Everything I had hoped from Wright, Pegg and Frost. They clearly LOVE horror movies, but with this they took the zombies into our lives. Theres so much truth in this movie... get to the pub. Simple. True. FUNNY!  [SUPPORTED THEARTICALLY]	2
2539	Se7en	David Fincher makes a dark, really compelling thriller. This is a story about the absolutely inevitability of sin. It's hard to watch, and hard to stomach but is obviously a film with mastery over every single aspect of film making.	1
2540	Maid in Manhattan	I hate to admit it but i really do like this movie	0
2541	American Beauty	Extremely overrated film about nothing.	0
2542	American History X	Absolutely sensational performance by Edward Norton, portraying a transformation from neo-nazi to second coming.  Stacy Keach and Avery Brooks shine in pivotal roles, but Norton's is the performance of a lifetime.	2
2543	Inception	Best thing about this movie (and there is a lot to choose from): You can take almost anyone, and everyone will enjoy it.	2
2544	Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog	Whedon. NPH. Nothing more needs to be said.	1
2545	Pan's Labyrinth	By and far my favorite movie ever thus far. The acting is phenomenal on all accounts and the story, the fairy tale for adults, is dark, twisted, and epic. I know some people who won't watch this film just because it's in Spanish and they don't like subtitles. Frack them, this is easily the best movie ever.	2

2547	Donnie Darko	Strange, thought-provoking move that explores the troubled mind of Donnie Darko, maniacally played by Jake Gyllenhaal.  This movie has my favorite female cast, including the always stunning Drew Barrymore, Jena Malone, Mary McDonnel, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Katharine Ross.  Through the film, we come to understand the inner workings of a troubled teen living in suburbia.  The script can be slightly confusing, but the story is entrancing from the beginning.  Beautiful, suspense-filled film.	2
2548	Enchanted	Its cute.  The chipmunk is the star of the show!!!	2

2556	Inglourious Basterds	Surprisingly funny; reminds me of earlier Quentin Tarantino work such as 'Four Rooms' with creatively interlocking story lines.  Plenty of gore and suspense - I'd certainly watch this one again.	2
2557	Gummo	Simply stated-this movie was horrible! I couldn't even get through it. I don't understand how a tornado could have screwed up these people so much. Cat killing and fornication with the mentally challenged is not even a slight bit entertaining to me. What the hell was this?	0

2562	The Godfather	Pretty good, a bit long though.	2
2563	Twilight	Vampire baseball. Beautiful, sparkling vampire baseball.	2
2564	Four Lions	An extremely funny yet unsettling view of terrorism in London. While most of the situations are hilarious (blowing up crows, the costumes, etc.), the movie still carried a dark overtone... maybe because there are idiot jihadists out there in public. But there was also a lot of quick, witty dialogue, so I couldn't help but smirk and laugh the whole time through.	2
2565	Blood Freak	Kind of impossible to rank - it's hilariously enjoyable but completely and utterly inept.  Seriously, the production values and pacing make Ed Wood look like Orson Welles; but it's certainly one of the gems of so-bad-it's-good cinema.	2
2566	Wonder Woman	Can't believe I've been tricked into watching yet another mediocre superhero film	0
2567	AVP: Alien vs. Predator	although the movie had an interesting beginning, it declined in free fall within seconds. 	0
2568	Jurassic Park	Monumental. This is what you happens when you team up the best Sci-Fi/Thriller author with the best director and the best composer. The production equivalent of the 1992 Dream Team put together one of the most well known, epic films ever.	2
2569	The Big Lebowski	A great cult hit with memorable quotes and a striking style. More awesome than you think.	2
2570	AVP: Alien vs. Predator	although the movie had an interesting beginning, it declined in free fall within seconds. 	0
2571	Bottle Shock	Alan Rickman plays Steven Spurrier, a British wine snob who goes to California in 1976 to see if he can find wines to rival the French wines for a publicity stunt -a blind taste test in what became known as The Judgement of Paris.  It is good if not as earthshattering as its subject matter - Rickman is especially funny and expressive as he tastes Napa Valley wines, guacamole and KFC for the first time.	1
2572	Equilibrium	I will never understand everyone's love for this movie. Its an absolute rip off of Matrix/1984/Fahrenheit 451. Gun-kata is for 12 year olds and manchildren and every single action scene plays out like it was written by people on GameFAQs on the fanfiction board. The dystopian future is handled in the most hamfisted way possible its absolutely ridiculous. Bales worst role and I genuinely feel bad for him for being in this movie that settles for banality and out right plagarism. 	0
2573	Twilight	exaggerated vampire image with ridiculous color scheme, very poor establishment of the story, this movie would only rock virgin/horny minds of teenagers, with a love story that's supposed to develop between the main characters, which not likely would convince nor satisfy any sensible viewer. 	0
2574	Raiders of the Lost Ark	God vs. Nazis.  How cool is that?	0
2575	Head-On	Scorching tale of two Turkish immigrants in Germany, who meet in a hospital after both attempt suicide, and how their marriage of convience (she wants to escape her controlling family) leads to unexpected developments; a bit sluggish at times, but ultimately very rewarding, thanks a script written with depth and affection, and especially due to the unforgettable performances of the two leads.	2
2576	Requiem for a Dream	To Sad to enjoy.	0
2577	Roma	Beautifully shot, but has too much of the AUTEUR(c) stamp on it. A movie that tries to hard to be something more than a movie -- every scene presented as SIGNIFICANT. But the cinematography is gorgeous. 	2
2578	Gattaca	Powerful story of a dystopian future. Raises questions about what makes a person have value. Anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction will not be disappointed.	2
2579	Salt	This movie made me feel like I un-learned my degree. It gives the audience absolutely no credit by telling a story that fundamentally does not make any sense. The characters are unlikable, relationships and motives are unbelievable; many characters are seemingly added only to tie up loose ends and offer no value to the overall story. Save your money on this and go see Inception again.	0
2580	City of God	one of my favorite films. a lot of entertainment.	2
2581	The Hours	One note. A film that confuses slow pacing and a beige atmosphere with actual artistry. Soulless and boring, and has a flat view of depression, which is a bit offensive. 	0
2582	The Truman Show	great film	2
2583	Coco	Pixar is getting lazy.	0
2584	Predator 2	a hollow shell of the first film but at least bill paxton and gary busey are there to ham it up	2
2585	Serenity	"Excellent sci-fi at it's most innovative. 

What would happen if Han Solo got his own movie? "	2
2586	Memento	An amazing piece of filmmaking that brings up a great deal of questions about our ways of knowing and whether or not our goals are truly in our best interests. It innovates without being pretentious.	2
2587	Isle of Dogs	Not his best work, but a bad Wes film is still enjoyable. 	2
2588	Spirit of the Beehive	Watching this film is detaching oneself from reality, and just letting Ana Torrent and the Spanish countryside take you on a little bit of a journey. The little girl tells the story through the reflection in her big brown eyes- we sympathize with her every move, and as the movie begins to take on an almost Frankenstein-like aura itself, I was left awed as the credits began to role and beyond, as I was entangled in silence, I had to let my breath come back and wonder... what had I just seen? One 	2
2589	The Gorgon	Gets points for originality (using a monster from Greek Mythology in a Gothic setting instead of rehashing a popular, pre-established creature). Also gets points for acting, but It's a Hammer film from the 60s ( all the acting was pretty much great in these). Cushing sports a killer 'stache as does Lee. I suppose matching mustaches were in their contracts for this one. The film is a bit repetitive but occasionally effective. Equal parts classy/great and boring/cheesy. A '70' I say! 	0

2601	Inception	The most intellectually satisfying heist film there is.	2
2602	Suspiria	argento starts the movie with all kinds of atmosphere and doesn't let up. the colors, imagery, set design and camerawork make for an incredibly stimulating visual journey. there are some shocking death scenes and some creepy moments but overall there is much more ambience than substance to the story - and i really don't mind that at all. suspiria makes a perfect mood setter for a scary movie night.	2

2613	The Third Man	I'm going to be vilified for saying this, but I really thought the film was overrated. It was shot beautifully, sure.. But the characters just aren't engaging at all. Cotten's character is a bore, I don't understand why anyone has any loyalty to Lime, and Anna is not worth the trouble. The mood set by the cinematography is offset by the jarring music.

 & This & really enjoyed it (the other movies of his never cared for of what I saw) 
 
 However I think I like it more for Robert Downey jr. & Jack Black  I'd say more but I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone"	0

2617	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	Not a bad adaptation (and God it's famous for being impossible) although the end is really odd. 	2
2618	The Box	Another proof that a woman can ruin your life.	0
2619	Into the Wild	An inappropriately loving tribute to one man's complete idiocy and selfishness, and and his surrounding's uselessness. Let us all shed tears.	2
2620	You Can Count On Me	Lovely, lovely, lovely. Simple story well told. A movie that breathes, that lets you in, doesn't force itself on you.	2

2622	Drive	Refns second Masterpiece	2

2624	Josie and the Pussycats	extremely underrated. This movie's message is about the corruption of the music and media industry, and the friendship at the mercy of it.	1
2625	Boogie Nights	Borrows from Altman, but is a really great and mostly original and heavily odd family film. Note: Not a film for families, but about one. Sort of a Godfather of Porno.	1
2626	Fando and Lis	Una de las cintas mas extrañas que he visto, llena de cargas simbolicas, metafisicas, y de una forma de ver las cosas demasiado extraña para ese tiempo, esta pelicula es precursora de un cine demasiado extraño.	2

2628	The Battle of Algiers	A film delivered like a punch in your stomach.	2
2629	The Man Who Wasn't There	And neither was I .... as I had fallen asleep twice watching this movie.Third time was a charm... sort of... as I still just couldn't be won over.Was it the slow drawn out pace,the laconic tones and dark background, who knows.Was trying to work out where the movie was going and just didn't care in the end and found the ending to be ...unfulfilling.Nice performance by the laid back Billy Bob Thornton though.	0
2630	The Black Dahlia	Terrible to the point that it made me angry. Terrible acting all around. I seriously thought that Fiona Shaw woman was Molli Shannon because she played her part like she was in a slapstick--a particularly grating performance. The plot was convoluted and boring. 121 minutes of DePalma shitting in my eyes.	0
2631	Happy Feet	Ahhhhh! yuck.	1
2632	Prom Night	Terrible remake of a not-so-great 80s horror movie. Very little blood makes this a useless horror movie. Horrible acting makes it not worth watching at all.	0
2633	Real Life	Waaayyy ahead of it's time. Satire of the highest order, helped by some pitch-perfect acting by Charles Grodin. Since most of the humor is in the setup, the film loses steam as it reaches the self-referential 3rd act...but Brooks does an admirable job of keeping you hooked until the credits roll.	2

2635	The Lion King	Unlike other reviewers I found it highly original. However, I probably ought to point out that this is the first movie I've ever seen. I'm 12 days old, and I already love going to the cinema, at least according to my dad. When I grow old enough to be able to actually see the screen and stay awake for more than 1% of the film, I'll probably be even more flabbergasted and impressed.	2
2636	Inception	Near perfect entertainment. While I recognize it's problems, Inception is cleverly written, exceptionally acted and beautifully shot. 	2
2637	Audition	If you've never heard of this movie, see it, don't ask about it, just see it. If you have heard of it and not seen it, what are you waiting for?	2

2640	The Border	I like it. Great music by Ry Cooder!	2
2641	City of Life and Death	Hypocritical, pretentious, and empty. The attempt to cater for west moral was so obvious but ended up being filled with stereotyped images and gaudy scenes. The utilisation of nationalism was so stupidly commercialised but pretend to be noble. This arrogant attitude showed clearly in the movie was really disgusting.  	0
2642	Raiders of the Lost Ark	recently re-watched. classic wit and whizz-bang plot.	2
2643	Inception	Inception is by far the most engaging movie of the season and the best movie of the year. There is a sense that everything else Nolan has done before as a director has led to this, his most accomplished movie yet. See it to believe it. 	2
2644	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	I am not a prude, but this film is the only one I've ever considered to be filthy in my life.  Pasolini was a sick perverted scumbag, and he was allowed to project his basest fantasies onto the big screen under the guise of social commentary.  It's as if a person into bestiality made a film of men screwing sheep and then justified it by calling it a critique on man's harsh treatment of livestock.  This film made me sick to my stomach and if I could give it a negative score, I would.  It'	0

2646	Grave of the Fireflies	Beautiful and heartbreaking. Everyone should see this at least once in their lives.	2
2647	Ocean's 8	Although Ocean's 8 isn't you're generic chick-flick, it is a good example of how editing can make or break a story. No scene is given the appropriate amount of time for it to stick, making it feel unpolished, unfinished and bland. There were times where it was impossible to tell if a line of dialogue was a joke or just poorly delivered. No character has a unique enough personality for me to tell them apart. Ocean's 8 feels more like sloppy 4ths than a reward. 	0

Just another stupid and cliche ode to the american way of life and all this shit than it's not funny anymore.	1
2650	Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog	Great stuff densely packed in about half an hour - this musical never gets boring or drags, it's just loads of fun to watch, and, obviously, to sing along ; ) Very charming and definitely worth the time watching.	2

2668	Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)	Completely pointless movie. I laughed at the beginning but when the centipede was ready it became boring.	0
2669	The Third Man	I'm going to be vilified for saying this, but I really thought the film was overrated. It was shot beautifully, sure.. But the characters just aren't engaging at all. Cotten's character is a bore, I don't understand why anyone has any loyalty to Lime, and Anna is not worth the trouble. The mood set by the cinematography is offset by the jarring music. Sorry, but this is overrated.	1
2670	Sucker Punch	As others already said, either you'll like this movie or you'll hate it. For me, watching Sucker Punch feels a bit like being trapped in the brain of a pubescent boy with the appearance of: hot girls in short skirts, samurai warriors with guns, zombie-steampunk soldiers, dragons and robots. To wrap things up and as a silly excuse everything is a (caution: spoiler!) dream - not really original. In combination with a mediocre soundtrack and CGI effects this was a waste of precious lifetime.	0

2683	Beauty and the Beast	Wonderful characters, fantastic and memorable songs, and a beautiful story. I've lost count the amount of times I've seen this and it never gets old. Disney's best film.	2
2684	The Lego Movie	I wonder at the fleet of lawyers they must have assembled to enable this jubilant paean to mashup culture.	2
2685	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	A perfect movie, back when Jack used to act.	2
2686	Melancholia	Nihilistic poetry constructed with quavering images - the masterful portrayal of how we humans are, as Freud said, disgraced and at the same time inexorably formed by social relations based on hypocrisy and conventions, and the difficulty of leaving it behind once and for all.	2
2687	Muriel's Wedding	Despite having some tragically dark elements, this movie is uplifting and feel-good in the best way. Collette and Griffiths are terrific actors and they bring this off so well. If only all chick flicks were as substantial and fulfilling as this one!	2
2688	Crossroads	"Lack of nudity = -50.

2690	Captain Marvel	Brie Larson might not quite put you off with her bland and uncharismatic portrayal of Captain Marvel, but she'll damn well try. 	2
2691	Ex Machina	A very cool and neat plot. It nails the suspense and sci-fi factors. Another movie that just makes you tense up and think.	2
2692	Predestination	It shifts your perception of time-travel movies into a new level. I'm not the fan of time travel movies, but this movie is so emotional to ignore it.	2
2693	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	Probably the best Spider-man movie yet. The artistic style of the movie is pulled off like nothing else. The carefree tone sets itself apart from other superhero movies, allowing for a character-centric flick that compares to some of the best. Again the visuals are sheer beauty that sets itself apart from other animated mainstream movies.	2
2694	The Matrix	One of the most innovative action movies to come in a longtime. Best movie in the trilogy.	2
2695	John Wick	no nonsense, no bull-shit revenge movie. wish they were ALL like this. 	0
2696	Inception	Original, incredible effects, fantastic performances, and wondrous directing by Christopher Nolan.  The script has a little too much expository dialogue to guide the audience along, although introducing Ellen Page's character as similarly unfamiliar to the world and having her grow and understand everything as we do was a great decision.  The best part of the film, in my opinion is that it enacts the idea of inception onto the viewer with the ending.  Oh and that hallway scene too.	1
2697	Get Out	and GET IN to the nearest multiplex showing Get Out! 	1
2698	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Definitely felt like Star Wars.	2
2699	Bloodsport	I don't know if I'm reviewing Kickboxer or Bloodsport.  I've mashed both films together in my mind named Kicksport.  Either way, its Van Damm kicking, punching, yelling in slow motion, and doing impossible splits.  One of the lower-tiered action movies from the 80s but still enjoyable and one of JCVD's best movies.  Or maybe I'm thinking of Kickboxer.  Shrug.	0
2700	Paper Towns	Paper Towns is truly a pleasant surprise - the film has great acting from the entire cast, a superb story and a near enough completely accurate representation of today's teen culture. The film is also smart and brings the audience on the adventure. The film may not have the ending you were expecting but the choices that are made are probably the most realistic. Paper Towns is also a beautiful film - some of the shots were really pleasing to the eye. 	2

2714	The Tall Man	Did not see it coming. Cool twist.	1
2715	War Horse	Ok, let's go... the cinematography was generally good but those colours at the end were just awful, score was painful, production design was too picture perfect, the acting was average, and I couldn't really care for any of the characters! The only really good thing was the war scenes; not surprising coming from the man who did 'Saving Private Ryan'. The rest? A load of Hollywood saccharine shite!!! Definitely not a film to watch when one is terribly sad, but hey a little catharsis always helps.	2
2716	Her	Her depicts or over reliance on technology and how it enters the final frontier of emotional interaction.	0
2717	There Will Be Blood	Daniel Day-Lewis delivered a truly phenomenal performance; capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past; this is not the case for There Will Be Blood. The cinematography is spectacular; the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters is captured beautifully.  Best of 2007.  	2
2718	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles	Filmde sadece Megan Fox var artı olarak ama onunda oyunculuğunun ne düzeyde olduğu belli. CW'nun boş aksiyon dizileri kıvamında. Yani ne aksiyonu aksiyon ne de senaryosu düzgün. 	1
2719	Phantom Thread	This is precise and marvelous filmmaking. Rich characters, beautiful music, great storytelling and incredible performances. Left me feeling shattered and uplifted at the same time. And obviously PTA knows a thing or two about marriages.	2
2720	The Matrix	Mind-blowing cinema; a perfect blend of action and thought-provoking substance. 	2
2721	Toy Story 3	The best animated blockbuster ever made.  Really a crowning achievement for Pixar.	2
2722	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Unresolved. A complex movie with complex characters that leaves almost everything unresolved. This may sound like a negative but it's not; but it does mean that it will not be to everyone's liking. No tidy endings or simple characters but a pretty good film. 	2
2723	Under the Skin	bullshit!	1
2724	I, Tonya	please don't make them talk into the camera!	1
2725	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Captivating, laugh-out-loud funny, deeply moving, emotionally beautiful, and perhaps the least predictable film I've ever seen. It's the kind of film that makes me pause frequently to try to predict what will happen or consider what I'd do in a character's place. Very engaging.	2
2726	Valhalla Rising	I did not like it too much but one should see it.  Neo-pagan mystical movie with anti-Christian overtones. A lot of subtle connections with Odin and Norse mythology.	1
2727	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Iconic performance by Jack Nicholson, back before he was just channelling the legend of Jack.	2

2743	A Cinderella Story	It's cute and sweet, I guess. Occasionally funny. The main character, played by Duff, is likeable enough. It gives one of the most beloved tales of all time a modern twist. Problem is, it's nothing new. It's just as generic as you'd expect. The film just feels recycled and choppy, throwing in every high school cliché you can imagine, minus alcohol and gratuitous nudity. It's a harmless piece of entertainment if you're looking to kill time, but that's all there is to it.	0

Cons: Trails off after the climax. Somewhat underwhelming ending."	2
2764	Alien	Visionary movie.  Incredible.  Intense.	2
2765	Inception	Corporate espionage, lucid dreaming, and Edith Piaf make for a unique movie. Hampered by modern thriller indulgences, but to be fair there hasn't been anything this good in a long, long time. 	1
2766	District 9	At first, District 9 immerses you with its gripping, socially relevant story and its near-perfect visuals. The documentary style makes you feel as though this movie's characters and events are real. As the story progresses and the movie departs from the short film, you begin to notice the fundamental flaw of the film. The movie is littered with plot holes, covered with them in fact. First you question the reasoning behind plot devices, then you realize that the whole film doesn't make any sense.	0
2767	Shaun of the Dead	This movie is absolutely hilarious. It is an excellent spoof on the zombie film and actually provides a few intense moments along with the laughs. A great film indeed.	2

2781	Mad Max: Fury Road	I was not sure what to expect going into this movie. The Mel Gibson Mad Max movies were good, but it always felt like the world wasn't crazy enough to support the ideas behind the scripts. Something was missing, and that something made me like but feel cold towards Mad Max.  This movie filled in every missing piece that the previous movies were lacking in my opinion.  The world was insane, the world was truly the world after an apocalypse, and the world was truly the world built for Mad Max.	1
2782	The Fault in Our Stars	I loved this movie. I thought it was just as great as the book. I like that they kept in a lot of the dialogue from the book and how the characters are written in a way that is not like the teens we see today. The two characters think about the important things in life and not about the superficial stuff that most teens think about nowadays. This is a must see. Just make sure to see this film with a box of tissue and without a theater full of immature teens (based on experience lol)	0
2783	City of God	City of God  powerfully shows the warped youth of the slums of Brazil. Powerful performances and visuals give this tail an emotional level that will stick with you days after watching.	2
2784	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Good pacing, no gratuitous plot, beautifully crafted message to counter current American culture of belligerence. 	2
2785	The Room	one of the worst movies ever, its only value is that is (involuntarily) funny as hell.	0
2786	Annie Hall	This is more about a relationship and how it unraveled. It's subtleties leave an impression of a deep and complex love. By the end of the movie, audiences have become to love and root for the characters to stay together. Inevitably, they don't, and it's a kind of tragedy. But it's also hilarious, which keeps it from being chick-flick-y. It beat out Star Wars for Best Picture in 1977. MUST SEE. SERIOUSLY. Favorite Movie of All Time.	2
2787	District 9	Great acting. Great immersion of fake cgi aliens and humans on screen. Good  Action. No unnecessary twist. Great film. 	2
2788	Leprechaun	A movie about a killer leprechaun. You get about what you'd expect.	1
2789	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Written by the guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies, this is a witty, unconventional take on the murder mystery genre. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious, with Val Kilmer completing the other half of a comedic duo that has excellent chemistry. Michelle Monaghan provides some good laughs herself, along with her looks. Highly quotable, intelligent comedy.	2
2790	Donnie Darko	This scares me more than ten Rings altogether!  	1
2791	The Incredibles	One of the best superhero movies I've seen. Great character dynamics, hilarious comedy and some exceptional action. Weird Randian subtext, villain wants to elevate regular humans to superherodom; remeniscent of a Promtheus metaphor. May be unintentional. Very little to say about this one other than: Great!	2
2792	John Wick	Oh, hell yeah, this owns. Rising above the standard issues of a lot of American made action movies, John Wick is a stylish revenge flick that absolutely blew me away. The story is nothing special, but this is a blast to watch. Every scene is just oozing style, and bold color and sound make the movie come to life. This honestly has some of the best gunplay I've ever seen in a movie. The world the movie creates in interesting, and it is populated with intriguing characters.	2
2793	Song of the Sea	I saw this at the cinema recently, and all I can say is...''wow''. Such a beautiful movie. The animation is some of the best I've seen in a long time. Great to see traditional animation, as opposed to CGI, being used in a new animated movie. And I love how the animation looks like it's from a picture book. The Irish mythology is so great, this movie makes me want to find out more about it. In short, this was the best new movie I've seen in a long time. Recommended for all humans	2
2794	L'Eclisse	This is my third Antonioni film and the third time in which I walk away with nothing but regret at having wasted two hours on a story and characters that I neither care about or understand. Nearing the end of the film, I didn't think it was any worse than L'Avventura but the last few minutes of this film really annoyed me.	0
2795	The Room	"Well, you can't give it both 0 or 100. :( 
  Therefore: 50"	1
2796	X-Men Origins: Wolverine	This movie is so bad, i considered (and immediately deleted evidence of the idea caming to my mind, yet still considered) to burning my comic books, throwing them from window to street then go out and burn them again, on the street, just to be sure.	0
2797	Watchmen	I don't care what everyone says about this movie. Zach Snyder is awesome and his rendition of Watchmen is probably as good as it gets for all the fans of graphic novels. I loved this movie.	2
2798	This Is 40	"Loved this movie, it's long but full of laughs. It's so REAL as well and very relatable. 
"	2
2799	Enchanted	Funny cross of princess and witch , Enchanted is the film I love to watch 2 times a week. Unlike the other Tales , it's crossed and mix.	2
2800	The Fault in Our Stars	I loved this movie. I thought it was just as great as the book. I like that they kept in a lot of the dialogue from the book and how the characters are written in a way that is not like the teens we see today. The two characters think about the important things in life and not about the superficial stuff that most teens think about nowadays. This is a must see. Just make sure to see this film with a box of tissue and without a theater full of immature teens (based on experience lol)	0
2801	Soultaker	Out of all the movies I've seen MST3K'd, this was probably the best of them so far. Not to say that it's a *good* movie by any means (hint: it's not), but it has an interesting concept, does some interesting things with it, and has fairly decent actors (Despite how much he's mocked by Mike and the bots, Joe Estevez isn't *that* bad). Sadly, that's not enough to redeem it, mainly because of poor editing and screenwriting. The movie drags on far longer than it should, especially at the end.	1
2802	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Good pacing, no gratuitous plot, beautifully crafted message to counter current American culture of belligerence. 	2

2808	Desu nôto	Duzo niezgodnosci z anime, ale film ma pewien klimat wyciagniety z anime. Niewiarygodne jak celnie w stosunku do mangowego odpowiednika dobrali L. ;) Bardzo dobrze zrobiona adaptacja.	1
2809	The Passion of the Christ	A visceral and the most realistic portrayal of the sheer brutality of death by crucifixion.  Not for the faint of heart, but emotionally gripping.	2
2810	City of God	City of God  powerfully shows the warped youth of the slums of Brazil. Powerful performances and visuals give this tail an emotional level that will stick with you days after watching.	2
2811	Elf	Will Ferrell does it again..another hilarious movie and I love how they included peter billingsly as one of the elves awesome idea to do that. I also think that Zooey Deschanel does an awesome job.	2
2812	The Ghost Writer	Not bad, but in the middle looks like a BMW commercial :(	0
2813	Transsiberian	This was a solid thriller in an unconventional setting. I won't tell details about the plot and thus spoil your experience but I cannot say that this impressed me much. Good performances by Emily Mortimer and Ben Kingsley, very good performance by Eduardo Noriega. Some brutality, sometimes gripping psychological performance by Mortimer, but the plot was lacking quite a bit, could not really point to where and why, this just was not good enough to get at me.	0
2814	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Written by the guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies, this is a witty, unconventional take on the murder mystery genre.

2816	The Passion of the Christ	A visceral and the most realistic portrayal of the sheer brutality of death by crucifixion.  Not for the faint of heart, but emotionally gripping.	2
2817	Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace	A fun film, and while not impressive by filmic standards, I am a huge fan and can't help but find the Star Wars' films endearing.	2
2818	Soultaker	Out of all the movies I've seen MST3K'd, this was probably the best of them so far. Not to say that it's a *good* movie by any means (hint: it's not), but it has an interesting concept, does some interesting things with it, and has fairly decent actors (Despite how much he's mocked by Mike and the bots, Joe Estevez isn't *that* bad).

2819	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Good pacing, no gratuitous plot, beautifully crafted message to counter current American culture of belligerence. 	2
2820	Drive	Tries very hard to be artsy and deep, but long wordless shots go to waste because there is no message they would underline.	0
2821	The Big Lebowski	Well written, well acted and well deserving of its cult status, the Coen brothers direct this hilarious film with fantastic performances all around. It still suffers from typical flaws seen in previous Coen pictures, IE; falling apart in the third act but the events and story leading up to the end more than make up for a bit of a lackluster conclusion. It isn't perfect, but it contains some of the best characters and greatest quotes in all of film history, making it worthy of multiple viewings.	2
2822	Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	definitely the most skillfully crafted star wars movie, but maybe not the most entertaining one. This is the movie that brought us the biggest twist in movie-history!	2
2823	The Thing	I don't hear people talking about this movie as much as about Alien, and that's so unfair.	1
2824	Being There	Like the main character, this movie is a little simple, yet is misunderstood to be brilliant by everyone.	2
2825	Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead	Oh yes, I love this movie a lot.  The way they play with words and ideas is so much fun that it never gets old.  And watching adorably young Tim Roth and Gary Oldman interacting, with Richard Dreyfuss often popping in to play along, is just delicious.	2
2826	Fight Club	The quintessential film of my post-modern generation, with  a strange and unexpected twist that makes the viewer question their whole notion of identity. The writing is amazing, the acting sublime, and the visuals striking. You can't miss it.	2
2827	Shaun of the Dead	Shaun of the Dead is simultaneously one of the best zombie movies I've seen, and one of the best comedies. This should not be possible. But somehow the brilliant team behind Shaun stayed above the level of screwball parody (with the exception of one silly scene tacked onto the very end), delivering a compelling world-gone-undead action storyline, and still packing it with an endless supply of humor. Or should I spell it humour? I really enjoyed this movie.	2
2828	Thirteen	An unrealistic representation of the 'bad kid' lifestyle. No thirteen year olds are doing this kind of thing! Maybe 14 year olds.	0
2829	Dark City	One of the most underrated movies of all time.  Incredible performances and a fully realized world.	2
2830	Paranormal Activity 4	Ben makes this movie. It's BEN over for a while now.	1
2831	Inception	This is an amazing movie.  I can't say much about it except....GO SEE IT!!!!!  I loved it all three times I watched it.  I was never bored in any of the three sittings and it always held my interest.	2
2832	Fear X	Not perfect, but underrated Lynch-ian thriller by Refn.	2
2833	Anaconda	Anacdona is an EXCELLENT B-movie.  It's cheesy, fun, and has a fantastic performance from Jon Voight.  His death scene will be with me until the day I die. *wink*	2
2834	Black Hawk Down	One of the most realistic depictions of combat ever put on the screen.	2
2835	Coraline	A beautiful film with a feeble plot structure. Almost every frame is extremely thoughtfully composed, & the music is mothersbaugh-worthy in its playfulness & catchiness. The scene in the garden is a favorite. That said, the story proceeds like a video game; in fact, the whole second half could easily be divided into levels. More like Pan's Labyrinth than Nightmare Before Christmas.	2
2836	Ichi the Killer	Great Asian gangster film...packed with loads of gore!	2
2837	Pan's Labyrinth	Amazing movie - can be heavy in places, and don't watch it with the kids.	2
2838	Hereditary	Completely lost me at the end, which is too bad.	0
2839	Tabutta rövasata	could be considered good in 1996 and promising back then, but for now it's a lil bit overrated , except performance of Ugurlu.. 	0
2840	The Big Lebowski	One of my top 5 movies!	2
2841	Dirty Rotten Scoundrels	This film is a joy. It's not a slay-me-with-laughter comedy, but it is a make-me-feel-happy comedy with plenty of chuckle-worth humor. I grab this one when I want a laugh but I'm too tired to handle debilitating hilarity.	2
2842	Suicide Squad	With lethal doses of both hot and crazy, Margot Robbie is perfect as Harley Quinn. At least for me, she carries what little this movie has to offer. Will Smith is also passable as hitman turned good guy, Deadshot. They can, however, not save an utterly poor storyline as well as a remaining roster of painfully forgettable characters. Normally I enjoy Jared Leto, and coming in I really wanted to like this version of The Joker. The massacre of an icon was the movie's biggest letdown.	0
2843	Eternity and a Day	Angelopoulos' meditation on the meaning of one man's life is genuinely hypnotic in its way of transcending ordinary narrative. 	2
2844	The Mummy	One of the best action comedies in recent years, it inspired a good sequel and a great rollercoaster at Universal Studios, and in my mind cemented Brendan Fraser as a go-to guy in Hollywood. Great action scenes, really good acting for an action film, great story. Great great great!	2
2845	Citizen Kane	One of the most over-rated movies. Yes it was ahead of its time (cinematographically) _IN 1941_ but that's nothing new in 2010. Filmmakers have learned a lot since then. Yes, the story is good, and yes, Orson Welles can act (although I think he overacts a bit), so it's an ok film. But I've seen a lot of stories I find more compelling, I can't see what's so special about this one.	2
2846	The Incredibles	This is pretty much everything i love about cartoons all wrapped in one movie. Pixar outdid themselves (which is very hard to do) with this one. 	2
2847	Almost Famous	captures that time in music masterfully	2
2848	Blade	any of his Blade movies gets a 100	1
2849	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	This is what I want in Star Wars. If they keep it up like this I may forgive the prequels. Best Droid yet with K. The soundtrack was familiar yet new. Definitely for OG Star Wars fans.	2
2850	The Big Lebowski	One of my top 5 movies!	2
2851	Anaconda	Anacdona is an EXCELLENT B-movie.  It's cheesy, fun, and has a fantastic performance from Jon Voight.  His death scene will be with me until the day I die. *wink*	2

2876	Raiders of the Lost Ark	A top action adventure from a time when Spielberg and Lucas were at their best. By far the best of all the Indiana Jones movies.	2
2877	Dirty Rotten Scoundrels	This film is a joy. It's not a slay-me-with-laughter comedy, but it is a make-me-feel-happy comedy with plenty of chuckle-worth humor. I grab this one when I want a laugh but I'm too tired to handle debilitating hilarity.	2

2879	Eternity and a Day	Angelopoulos' meditation on the meaning of one man's life is genuinely hypnotic in its way of transcending ordinary narrative. 	2
2880	Once Upon a Time in America	So overlooked. It's difficult enough for a movie to entertain me for two hours, but this one had me at the edge of my seat for nearly four. A masterpiece as far as I'm concerned.	2
2881	Léon: The Professional	As you watch this movie (espesially the extended version) you come to realise that at heart this is a love story. Yes its sarounded by violence, drugs, and sex, but thats just the setting; the border that gives the messege shape. An incredible movie that is always on my Recomend list.	2
2882	Gone Girl	Rosamund Pike was an excellent yandere while Ben Affleck was good as the weak male harem lead, though maybe it'd have been better if he ended up with his sister.	2
2883	The Godfather	A masterpiece. The best there is. Gets better with every viewing. 	2
2884	Leprechaun	Not as good as some B-movies, but I like the Leprechaun for reasons I cannot explain.	0
2885	2001: A Space Odyssey	Everything up until the last 30 minutes is wonderful, beautiful, and unlike anything else. The last 30 minutes can pretty easily be recreated at home with a lava lamp.	2
2886	Open Your Eyes	Stay away from the remake. Originals are almost always better. 	2
2887	Embrace of the Serpent	"that movie was actually took me away from my daily problems and anxieties to unknown world. director of this movie can easily be considered as very good at storytelling and emotional transfer. i feel very uncomfortable after the movie in the sense that i have lots of things detracting me from freedom
"	2
2888	Serenity	Only the removal of Fox close-fistedness with some of the elements (simply because they let the series Firefly slip out of their hands through poor management and support) could have made this film any better. It;s everything a sci-fi space western should be	0
2889	Elite Squad	Wants to be City of God from the cops POV. Sadly, not even close to City of God. No plot, no drama. Only action could save this movie... and it doesn't. At least it does a good job of illustrating corruption in Brazil. 	0
2890	Forrest Gump	If you mindlessly go through life doing whatever you're told, become a millionaire. If you try to make some sort of sense of the world, get AIDS and die. I hate this film.	0
2891	3:10 to Yuma	Some good acting on Crowe's part still can't save this mess of a film with Bale at his worst, and a finale which defies logic and all previous character development just to give us a big whizz-bang finish.	0
2892	Se7en	It's stylish but very overrated.	2
2893	Fearless	Underrated masterpiece. No one went to see it because they were freaked out by plane crash and its aftermath. Jeff Bridges is brilliant. 	2
2894	Interstellar	just an ordinary space/sci-fi movie. 	0
2895	A Prophet	I'm disconcerted when a new film engages me as one of the all-time greats. Un prophète deserves every bit. Audiard crafted a film not only visceral, emotional and challenging, but entertaining (in the broadest sense; I am entertained by all good film). Malik is a stunning character put forth by a stunning performance, a character that simultaneously disgusts with despicable malice and inspires with bravery, perseverance and vulnerability. I felt for Malik, and confusingly so. Required viewing.	2
2896	No Country for Old Men	Excellent.	2
2897	Coco	The best animated film EVER!	2
2898	The Descent	I wish that this were a monster movie instead of a movie about a group of people whose emotional baggage totally overshadows the fact that there are FUCKING MONSTERS HUNTING YOU! The scariest parts were when people were just trapped underground. That's scary. Twitchy, pale humanoid things who crawl around and snarl haven't been scary in years.	0
2899	Scooby-Doo	Way to destroy my fond childhood memories. This is not Scooby-Doo. If you want Scooby-Doo go watch the original series from the 70's.	0
2900	Godzilla	I took two things away from this movie, That the French are bad for creating Godzilla and that the American military would have a hard time finding Godzilla and his kaiju-fascist nest hiding in the hills of Manhatten. And boredom. Three things! And a low groaning noise. Four things!	0
2901	Lady Bird	I gave it an 89, after my first viewing. Now, after having seen it 2 1/2 more times, I like it even more so and have upped my score, accordingly, to a 93.	1
2902	Suspiria	Suspiria is a brilliant, unique, and disturbing motion picture. It is not to be missed.	2
2903	The Ghost Writer	Technically competent but snoozy thriller.  Also, directed by a child rapist, so there's that.	2
2904	Kingpin	So many people I know love this movie; I just don't get it. It's pretty formulaic.	2
2905	Shaolin Soccer	Has some funny moments, but for the most part fails to live up to wuxia standards. It seemed like the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a wire-fu epic or a lowest common denominator comedy, and the compromise it strikes... doesn't work well.	0
2906	The Fountain	Richly complex in its filmography and artistic style, the fountain is overflowing with deep emotion and thoughtful expression. A sad tale of grief, pain, and the process of learning to live in the face of death. Underrated by those who don't understand its metaphorical presence, The Fountain is a film that achieves the impossible: expressing in 90 minutes the love it took a lifetime to build and eternity to understand.	2
2907	Dirty Dancing	not very dirty by today's standards if I'm being perfectly honest	0
2908	The Fast and the Furious	Only for the charger...everything else sucked balls	0
2909	City of God	exhilarating	2
2910	The Fast and the Furious	Only for the charger...everything else sucked balls	0
2911	City of God	exhilarating	2
2912	The Core	This is like... a cliche, kinda crappy movie that you can't help but like a little but when you watch it. It's at least entertaining.	0
2913	The Devil's Rejects	hell yeah!  zombie nails it	0
2914	American Beauty	Works great as a comedy.  Don't go in expecting to get your life changed though.	1
2915	Mulholland Drive	I was confused, in a good way.	0
2916	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	I think this was the start of Kubrick's long streak of brilliance. Also, this is Peter Sellers at one of his peaks. He makes Lolita the half-brilliant film it is, but here he gives Character Work a whole new name.	2
2917	Gerald's Game	Interesting idea, the movie was unfortunately not as great as the idea. The ending especially was unnecessary, and it would have served the movie a lot better, if more things were left unexplained.	0
2918	Mr. Arkadin	I hate loving this movie and love hating this movie. It's half parody, half mystery, half B movie, half art movie. But it has a second rate, hamfisted theatricality that turns my crank. Welles fans should find it (or what remains of it) interesting.	1
2919	Animal Kingdom	Features the best use of an Air Supply song.	2
2920	The Cat in the Hat	Couldn't even finish this one.	1

2924	The Fifth Element	one of gary oldman's greatest performances 	2
2925	Elite Squad	Wants to be City of God from the cops POV. Sadly, not even close to City of God. No plot, no drama. Only action could save this movie... and it doesn't. At least it does a good job of illustrating corruption in Brazil. 	0
2926	Ben-Hur	There has been at least four remakes of this film and NOT ONE has ever, and I don't think it will, surpass this '59 epic film. William Wyler's remake of the biblical tale changed and inspired many of Hollywood's filmmakers to create films that change our view of the world, and perhaps beyond it. It still remains as a work of historical epic cinema. Charlton Heston's performance will forever be remembered as his finest role in his career; I personally consider him the godfather of all actors. 	2
2927	The Neon Demon	Amazing cinematography, But something is wrong about the movie	1
2928	Catwoman	Hilarious.	2
2929	Sintel	A predictable yet entertaining animation short. Nothing's really exceptional (except maybe good photography and soundtrack) but it's worth your watch because you can see the effort they put in it.	2
2930	Suspiria	Suspiria is a brilliant, unique, and disturbing motion picture. It is not to be missed.	2
2931	The Ghost Writer	Technically competent but snoozy thriller.  Also, directed by a child rapist, so there's that.	2
2932	Kingpin	So many people I know love this movie; I just don't get it. It's pretty formulaic.	2
2933	Shaolin Soccer	Has some funny moments, but for the most part fails to live up to wuxia standards. It seemed like the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a wire-fu epic or a lowest common denominator comedy, and the compromise it strikes... doesn't work well.	0
2934	The Fountain	Richly complex in its filmography and artistic style, the fountain is overflowing with deep emotion and thoughtful expression. A sad tale of grief, pain, and the process of learning to live in the face of death. Underrated by those who don't understand its metaphorical presence, The Fountain is a film that achieves the impossible: expressing in 90 minutes the love it took a lifetime to build and eternity to understand.	2
2935	Mad Detective	Starts out very promising but keeps knocking down everything it sets up and throwing in red herrings until you stop trying to figure it out or caring.  Easy to say this is a masterpiece not appreciated by the masses, but if a movie isn't enjoyable enough the first time with the interpretations that the filmmakers know full well the majority of the audience is going to have, there won't be any second viewing to look at it in whatever complex or esoteric light the filmmakers were envisioning.	0
2936	Rain Man	Charlie Babbitt made a joke!	1
2937	The X-Files: I Want to Believe	I kept waiting for some (supernatural, conspiracy, what have you) to happen, but it didn't.	1
2938	The Grand Budapest Hotel	Sensational cinematography! The consequently symmetric framing opens up new camera perspectives and creates beautiful new views of standards such as the shootout scene. Wes Anderson revives and cleverly updates the slapstick humor of the silent movie era which (with absolutely no exception) his actors perform so brilliantly and so well timed that a cheshire cat sized grin will persistently stick to your face until the curtains close to that wild balalaika orchestra.	2
2939	The Hunchback of Notre Dame	A dark film for children, but perfectly suited for the adults watching it. 	2
2940	The Neon Demon	Amazing cinematography, But something is wrong about the movie	1
2941	Catwoman	Hilarious.	2
2942	Sintel	A predictable yet entertaining animation short. Nothing's really exceptional (except maybe good photography and soundtrack) but it's worth your watch because you can see the effort they put in it.	2
2943	Pan's Labyrinth	This film presented a wonderful fantasy that brings back nostalgia of classic epic tales someone might hear as a child. The levels on which this film can be viewed was also quite impressing, appealing to the adult audience as well. I loved the mixture of fantasy, fear, and suspense. 	2
2944	The Laughing Policeman	Solid 1970's cop movie, that has some pacing problems but has solid performances from Walther Matthau and the ever reliable Bruce Dern. Dern is so watchable he could fart into a bag for 90 minutes and I'd enjoy the hell out of it. Not quite a hidden gem, but infinitely better than the dross that passes for crime cinema at present	2
2945	Backdraft	I saw it, sat through it all, then couldn't remember a single thing that had just happened. Utterly forgettable.	0

2951	John Wick	Probably the worst movie I have seen in years. All the celebrity actors in the world cannot save you when you have no script whatsoever.	0
2952	Blacksmith Scene	I was moved to tears. The entire film is a metaphor for our daily lives; the struggle against the bourgeoisie; the small hurdles we must overcome during our daily lives. The subplot of the disloyal partner, I thought, was well done and subtle. Each one of the actors does an unbelievably excellent portrayal of their respective characters. They emote so wonderfully that you can't help but feel you truly are experiencing the best that film has to offer.	2

2957	Chinatown	Did I watch the same movie everyone else did?	1
2958	A Clockwork Orange	What impressed me the most in this movie, was the main protagonist's vocabulary - the distinct combination of English, Russian and Cockney rhyming captivated my attention to the very end of the movie. Alex's morale, the question of good vs evil and his angle on it is what prevails in this movie. You have to hate him, but you cannot feel sorry for him. The chaos, and the alternative 60's futuristic England makes the movie truly unforgettable experience.	2
2959	The Room	nul point should be reserved for films that have absolutely no merit. This film is very entertaining. As a backlash against those with sub-zero functioning humour receptors, I'm awarding this tragedy the 100 Percent Great Award For Being Great.	0
2960	The Cat in the Hat	I can't imagine kids really swooning over this film. Mike Meyers was a little too over the top. Dr. Seuss is best in books and the occasional animated Christmas classic.	2
2961	Lilo & Stitch	Who doesn't love Lilo & Stitch? As a kid, I used to watch the Disney Channel spinoff show religiously after school. I want to shake the hand of whoever thought of this beautiful juxtaposition-- part exciting space escapade, part girl-and-her-alien-dog buddy tale, and part family drama. That last element is what really makes the movie what it is, in my opinion. Nani should be hailed as a Disney princess in her own right for how hard she worked to be the best sister she could be. Love this movie.	2

2971	City of God	exhilarating	2
2972	Wonder Woman	Remove the sheer excitement people have for getting a female lead-role in a superhero film and you get a movie with some serious tropes, lengthy and drawn out introduction (half the film can be viewed as one big intro), unimaginative and underdeveloped main villain (and others villains) all of which bogs down what could've been a good movie with a pretty good cast, well acted and nice action scenes. This amounts to a mediocre film that I recommend watching as a rental and without expectations.	0
2973	The Royal Tenenbaums	I love the pacing and long spaces in this story. The simplest sentence has the weight of years behind it.  Review weighted by personal relevance, as tales of genius families ground down into mediocrity are of particular interest.	0

2977	The Interview	I have not seen this movie. (please don't kill me)	0
2978	Mr. Arkadin	I hate loving this movie and love hating this movie. It's half parody, half mystery, half B movie, half art movie. But it has a second rate, hamfisted theatricality that turns my crank. Welles fans should find it (or what remains of it) interesting.	1
2979	Animal Kingdom	Features the best use of an Air Supply song.	2
2980	The Last Samurai	Entertaining, if mildly insulting and totally overwrought.	2
2981	United 93	An absolutely amazing movie. I was spellbound, enthralled, and ENRAGED. I think the director and cast really did put aside the showbiz glitz and glamour and captured the real moment for a change. I really feel they honored those who lost their lives and their families. I challenge anyone who watches not to be moved to tears. This film should be required viewing for the leagues of milquetoast liberals who cry crocodile tears for the poor misunderstood murdering scumbags. 	0
2982	Week End	Jean-Luc Godard's official kiss-off the the New Wave in favor of film as an instrument for political revolution.  His most violent and infamous work and an important film.  	1
2983	Scarface	"Great film about the darker side of the fabled American Dream. Great performance of Pacino. The athmosphere in this movie is perfect, the music (both the score by Moroder and the songs appearing throughout) suck you into the experience.
Only downside to this movie is that so many 16-year-old wannabe gangstas adore this movie, I'm almost ashamed to tell anyone I like this film."	2
2984	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	It won't appeal to everyone, but fans of the graphic novels shouldn't be disappointed. Wright's directing is as fast-paced as ever and suits the source material to a tee. Some inspired casting, especially Knives Chau and Stephen Stills, and a fantastic soundtrack lead to a top film. In conclusion, this rocks ultimate.	2

2992	The Ghost Writer	Technically competent but snoozy thriller.  Also, directed by a child rapist, so there's that.	2
2993	Sneakers	It's fun. Suspend your disbelief, don't pick apart the spots where the technology is impossible, and let yourself be entertained. The characters are entertaining, acting is decent, and it has an interesting story.	2
2994	Bronson	 A heart jerking tale of a beautiful anti-hero clawing his way to stardom.... Via the British penal system. Fantastic acting, plotline, character development, and gypsy beating. A tender-footed aquantence turned me on to this film by saying I couldn't sit through this movie, it was too violent. fuck yes. Charlie bronson is a true hero, Eff anyone who disagrees.	2
2995	Black Hawk Down	Based on a true story, this film tells the tale of soldiers fighting to stay alive after a plan gone terribly wrong.  The only character truly visible in this film belongs to Josh Hartnett who gives perspective in the heat of battle.  It's a tear jerker, emotionally draining, and moves at such a pace that it brings the audience to the battle.  But what it does most of all is tell a story that needs to be told, about how the worst in mankind can sometimes bring out the best in men.	2

3002	Alice	Lewis Carroll's book was full of bizzare twists of logic. The weirdness of the book is captured well by Svankmajer's surrealistic style, but the book relied heavily on games with words. Given that Svankmajer chose to show a close up of a mouth everytime a word is uttered this naturally gets a bit grating after a while. It would have worked brilliantly as a short though!	2
3003	The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian	As well as the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe the great fairytale with nice epic battles. The good thing is, Caspian is darker and do not have to introduce so much characters as the first film. On the contrary, the plot feels to be more flat and camera not so good and effective. It's good and nice to be back in Narnia and enjoy the fairytale adventures again. 	2
3004	Hero	Amasing scenery, however the plot feels somewhat haphazard.	0
3005	The Fast and the Furious	I'm supposed to like films like this: fast cars, hot women, cool special effects, hip-hop soundtrack.  The cars may have looked good, but the camera never showed them any love.  The women were hot, but not enough skin (for this kind of movie).  The special effects were awesome, but had little to do with moving the story along.  The music: Ja Rule.  Don't even watch it on a bet.	2

3007	Reservoir Dogs	I've been told that you either love Reservoir Dogs and hate Pulp Fiction, or vice versa, and it holds true for me.  I've come to expect two things from Tarantino's movies: over-the-top violence, and absurd hilarity.  Reservoir Dogs only really delivered the former, and the end result was a less enjoyable movie.	0
3008	The Big Lebowski	Perhaps my favorite Coen Bros film - definitely top 3.  This is the movie Jeff Bridges should have won his Oscar for.  :)	2

3032	Prospect	Alien-like analog aesthetic, lean storyline, never tries to be anything it isn't, good performances, good watch	1
3033	The Act of Killing	A character arch unlike any I've seen. A documentary less about the human potential for cruelty and evil, and more about the birth of the soul.

3053	Howard the Duck	Aggressively unlikable on every level, Howard the Duck has something that's offensive to everyone's sensibilities.

Altogether, just deeply unpleasant.	0

3055	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	I'm 20. I wasn't alive when the original trilogy was released, i was too young to care about the prequels. I've since gone back to the original trilogy and i adore both New Hope and Empire, and have not bothered with the prequels. This film, IMO is the second best Star Wars film only to Empire. Progressive in a relaxed way, very funny, a lot of heart. Sure it borrows a lot from New Hope, but it had to please old fans whilst set up a new trilogy for a lot of new fans. Not Easy. Really great film.	2

3062	Ghostbusters	An unfunny and unnecessary remake of the 1984 classic that wastes the comedic talents of its lead actors.  The witty sarcasm and charm of the original have been replaced with juvenile humour and cynical nostalgia aimed at Gen-X'ers.  Hardly the political statement it was made out to be back in 2016, rather another forgettable remake from an era in Hollywood that was already overcrowded with them. 	1
3063	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	"Fabulous, epic and tragic conclusion of war in Middle-Earth.

3064	Jaws	This film is the master at creating suspense and it's probably one of Spielberg's best movies. Some truly memorable dialogue that I can still quote accurately to this day. And that iconic music still sends shivers down my spine whenever I hear it. Overall though it was a little drawn out in my opinion, but this is DEFINITELY a movie that everyone should see.	2
3065	Bohemian Rhapsody	Good portrayal of the band's story. I'm feeling the impression that they sanitized a lot the younger days of the group. Not bad.	2
3066	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	The problem I find with some Anderson films is that they are so entrenched in Andersonisms that it gets in the way of a good story and characters. Nonetheless,  this film is gorgeous to look at and beautifully made. Sadly the second half of the film drags and the ending felt a bit mashed together. Could have been a great 90 minute film.	2
3067	American History X	incredibly awesome, thoughtful movie. started admiring edward norton after this movie!	2
3068	Dirty Dancing	This movie taught me one thing - you can be anything you want if you set your mind to it. If someone as talentless and unattractive as Jennifer Grey can become an actress, you can be anything you like.	1
3069	Drive	A simple story, told absolutely beautifully.	2
3070	Her	Ultimately, the couple of hours you spend watching Her won't just have you entertained for the duration of the film, but they will have you pondering your existence, your friendships, your relationships, and much more for some time.	2
3071	The Babadook	Fantastic film. Uses many horror tropes to frame and provide background for some big issues. Very intelligent. Also features a brilliant central performance from Essie Davis, and some awesome sound design. Watch alone, in the dark with good headphones.	2
3072	Brazil	orwellian dystopia done better than orwell. just make sure you dont end up watching that crap happy ending studio edit.	0
3073	American History X	GREEEAT movie. Very nice dialogs, good acting, the cast is really talented, and the messages are really inspiring!!	2
3074	Inception	Good mind-blowing story, action, and effects. 	2
3075	Drive	Without a doubt one of the most creative getaway films I've ever seen, Drive uses its camera angles and lighting to its advantage. Its refusal to focus on the thrills is admirable, yet this means the film is entertaining in its own way. Drive focuses on emotion and character development rather than speed and excitement. All being topped off by a stellar performance from Ryan Gosling, this is a movie nobody should miss.	0
3076	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Loved it. An adaption worthy of the book in my opinion. The actors play their roles with amazing ease, and I find myself lost in the journey along with them.	2
3077	The Winning Season	I don't care if it's a little formula. Loved Sam Rockwell and enjoyed this movie from start to finish.	2
3078	Inglourious Basterds	That's a bingo!	1
3079	A Nightmare on Elm Street	one of the greatest horror films, and one of my all time favourite films, true classic	2
3080	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	Absolutely perfect. Brilliant concept artfully executed -- a film that will leave your brain cranking, not insulted.	2
3081	A Nightmare on Elm Street	one of the greatest horror films, and one of my all time favourite films, true classic	2
3082	Mad Max: Fury Road	My friend Will didn't like this movie, so I don't like him anymore.	1
3083	Prometheus	This is probably the most expensive B-movie made so far. And not half as much fun. Beautiful visually, but more preachy than a Sunday sermon. Didn't expect to be this disappointed. Comparing it to 'Alien' would be a joke. At least Michael Fassbender makes a handsome, well-spoken robot. 	0
3084	Survivor	i had trouble sleeping for the past few days -- luckily this flick helped me pass out cold. Boring, tedious, and full of irritating dialog, it's perfect for lulling you or a friend/relative off into sleep or even death.	0
3085	Edward Scissorhands	Johnny Depp before he became Johnny Depp. Good Burton film.	0
3086	Her	One of the best films of the young century. 	2
3087	Gremlins	Classic movie and sci fi kids movie!  Great to go back and watch the cheesiness!	2
3088	Serenity	Great movie! A must see for every Sci-Fi fan, but hey, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you certainly have seen it already.  Feature film based on the great Firefly series, which unfortunately and to the anger of the fans ran only for 13 episodes. This movie was made because of the huge amount of protests from all over the world following the cancellation of Firefly.	0
3089	City of God	A huge story with a huge cast about a huge topic. This film is pulled off excellently at every level, not being too much of anything negative.	1
3090	Visitor Q	Wow. Re-watched this again the other day. This is what cinema is about, just brilliant...ground breaking, sexually provoking, great acting with a wonderful quirky story. Overall a breath of fresh air, Hollywood and the sheep that follow can never have anything on films that challenge like this. This is cinema. A must see!	2
3091	Bruce Almighty	All the power of a god and that's all that he does with it?	2
3092	The Last Samurai	Well-shot, didn't like the ending.	2
3093	Home Alone	one of my all time favorites. still makes me laugh.	2
3094	The Descent	Oh. My. God.  I haven't been so satisfied with a story arc in a horror movie since...I don't know that I ever have.  Just the look in the eyes of the main character for the last quarter of the film...chilling.  The viciousness of the fight scenes also made me squeal with glee.  I'm not afraid to admit that.	2
3095	Batman	Campy goodness	1
3096	Shaun of the Dead	Very funny film that successfully combines comedy and horror. A clever satire of zombie films with Simon Pegg and his always present co-star Nick Frost. Good acting, hailarious movie worth watching. Still manages to be scary at the same time!	2
3097	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	This, as far as I can remember, was a great movie.	2
3098	The Incredibles	The Incredibles was cute the first time I saw it, but it's concept was cheesy and unlike many other Disney and Pixar, which I can see over and over again, I couldn't rewatch this failed to be classic film.	0
3099	Avengers: Age of Ultron	"Not very focused. Ad-libbing by Robet Downey Jr. and a couple of quips by others are refreshing.
Definitely not as good as the first one."	1
3100	The Evil Dead	Love this entire franchise, all started here	2
3101	Serenity	Great movie! A must see for every Sci-Fi fan, but hey, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you certainly have seen it already.

3102	City of God	A huge story with a huge cast about a huge topic. This film is pulled off excellently at every level, not being too much of anything negative.	1
3103	Pan's Labyrinth	Hauntingly beautiful and terrifying in its depiction of both fantastical horror and human brutality. Guillermo del Toro crafts a remarkably imaginative take on the fairy tale genre, set in the context of the real-life horrors of the Spanish Civil War.  Well-acted and heartwrenching - will be thinking about this one for a long time.	2
3104	Out of the Furnace	I thought the acting was excellent all-around, and the plot, though straight-forward, drew my sympathy. The film seemed a little awkwardly paced, however, and the ending felt anti-climactic. Still, I was solidly interested from beginning to end. 	1
3105	The Incredibles	The Incredibles was cute the first time I saw it, but it's concept was cheesy and unlike many other Disney and Pixar, which I can see over and over again, I couldn't rewatch this failed to be classic film.	0

3107	Jurassic Park	The classic. For 1993, the special effects are downright beautiful. Everything about this movie just works. It wraps around you like that hoodie your mother just washed. All warm and cozy. The suspense works, the action works, the smattering of CG and the emphasis on puppetry and animatronics gives everything a real feel that only can be relived from watching Alien or Predator, where the actors can actually have something to act against. Just a great, great, great piece of cinema.	2
3108	Morgan	You'll have to take an extra shot of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this one, as well as accept the couple idiot balls/characters inexplicably doing the exact opposite of what has been thoroughly established as their inflexible modus operandi 10 times before.   All that said, it's entertaining for what it is.	0
3109	The Matrix	Perfect... An icon of a new born digital era...	2

3111	The Matrix	Perfect... An icon of a new born digital era...	2
3112	Gladiator	This movie is one of my favorites. Ill think this is the movie ill seen most times.  Bravery, drama, hate, murders, war..! If u never seen Gladiator, ill say just do it, u wont be disapointed.	2
3113	Drive	stylistically sensational with unique memorable performances. brilliant cast, beautiful cinematography, the story never feels rushed or forced and it flows at a gripping pace. also the soundtrack is a modern classic	2

3115	Us	So I guess good posture is scary?	1
3116	The Descent	good horror movie	2
3117	Kick-Ass	So much fun. Exceeded expectations for sure.	2
3118	Irreversible	The music really intensifies this movie 	1
3119	Wreck-It Ralph	A wonderful film and one of Disney's very best.  The story is engaging, the characters lively and colourful and the message is clear and uplifting.  It belongs up there with the likes of Aladdin and the Lion King.	2
3120	Whiplash	The most intense movie I have ever seen. The pacing, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the sound editing. Whiplash is a masterpiece.	2
3121	Memento	Very intense and cleverly directed. Genius!	2
3122	Shaun of the Dead	My all-time favorite zombie film, and that's pretty hard to decide! It's funny because it combines two genre's that have nothing to do with each other (Zombie Movies, Romantic Comedies) and still succeeds on so many levels! 	2
3123	Back to the Future	Definitely one of the best sci-fi films of the eighties. Time travel is such a cool concept, and when you throw into the mix a crazy doctor and juggling the effects of messing with the time stream, it makes for a thrilling, adventurous movie.	2
3124	Toy Story	perfect.	2
3125	The Postman	I really like these post apocolyptic movies. Im not really a fan of Kevin Kostner, he just happens to be in a good number of these movies. That being said, I like this movie alot.	2
3126	Dudley Do-Right	Anything with Brendan Fraser in it, get's the Derek Jeter Tier.	0
3127	Avengers: Endgame	Ben hayatım boyunca sinemada bu kadar seyirci ile senkronize ilerleyip etkileşime girebilen bir film görmedim hatta sadece görmemekle de kalmayıp, yaşamadım. Avengers: Endgame; Marvel'ın tamamını içinde barındıran 3 saatlik epik bir göz ve ruh orgazmı. (25.04 Onur ile, IMAX)	0
3128	Mandy	In a way, similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, too bad I didn't like that movie either. The movie sacrificed character development, plot building, and overall entertainment value to be 'trippy' and weird. which I will admit, it was. But it wasn't enough. 	0
3129	Operation Finale	Bland and straightforward. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either. Decent acting but very little tension or drama	0
3130	Pearl Harbor	Where to start? Perhaps the most offensive thing about this trite, poorly written, badly acted, shameless crock of unfeasibility, is that so many people depend on media for their education, that they believed the series of events portrayed in this film actually happened. Or maybe it was the soundtrack. Who knows?	0
3131	Children of Men	11 Agost 2011 - Creació complexa, imaginativa però versemblant, aclaparadora, crua i moltes altres coses. Fotografia interessant i singular. Clive Owen segueix delitant-me, però moltes altres interpretacions interessants. Poderosa.	1
3132	Drive	Ace main character. Good music & OK story. 	2
3133	Carlito's Way	If you want to watch a phenomenon  and get high go watch Scarface, but if you want to see a truly moving picture this is it. Favor can kill you faster than a bullet.	0
3134	The Notebook	This film made me do two things that a film hasn't made me do in a while: cry, and, for a moment, believe that romantic love can be real. Excellent performances, beautifully filmed, moving.	2
3135	Memento	Whoa. What a ride.	1
3136	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	I thought Disney couldn't make nothing worse than the prequels. Sadly, I was wrong. There's still plenty of Star Wars elements to please fans, but the franchise legacy has already been lost.	1
3137	The Tree of Life	A hypnotic, spellbinding meditation on our world and the human condition. The Tree of Life is a ambitious and touching story about living in general. The points that are touched on in this film are astoundingly admirable and this film is incredibly inspiring. This film does everything Boyhood does and more and does it a hundred times better. I'm sort of at a loss for words because nothing I could say could possibly encompass my feelings about this film or do it any justice. Awe inspiring. 	1
3138	It Chapter Two	Just like the first film, it was much more of a coming-of-age film than a horror movie. Admittedly it was long, but I would say it had good reasons to be long. I really liked how the movie tried to equally cover the story of each character, although I understand some saying that it could have trimmed or shortened Eddie and Richie's stories.	0
3139	Titanic	What a boring blockbuster!	2
3140	X-Men Origins: Wolverine	Infantile dialogues, cheesy moon lovestory, lame superpowers. Bad acting (except for Hugh Jackman). Dumbass storyline inversions. A basically invincible Wolverine. What a waste of time	0
3141	Mongol	Thanks for making a movie about the rise of Genghis Khan that did a terrible job of showing how he became Genghis Khan. The parts that might have been interesting (Temudgin gathering followers after his many travails) are COMPLETELY skipped to make room for a bad romance and sweeping visuals. The landscapes were beautiful mind you, but why not make a travelogue if that's all you want? I wanted a historically accurate war epic about Genghis Khan, and if that's what you want, don't see this. 	2
3142	Memento	Whoa. What a ride.	1

3146	Antz	Mildly entertaining, but no match for the same year release of A Bugs Life.	1
3147	Serenity	Firefly was some of the greatest TV ever. I liked this movie, but didn't love with the same white hot Fox will rue the day they canceled passion. Nice to have the reaver mystery finally resolved.	2

3156	Ex Machina	"Almost flawless movie to me. 
So much research went into it and nobody decided to study physical education which led Oscar Isaac's Nathan doing biceps curls to look intimidating.
Let him deadlift - it will look better on camera!!!"	2
3157	The Incredibles	I am not a fan of Disney Movies. This movie had the perfect blend of style, story. humor, & action. I can watch this movie several times over. I am dying for a sequel! Highly recommended!	0

3167	The Thing	This is an excellent movie.  The atmosphere is great in the movie.. It could be compared to  Alien but this film arguebly depended more on the cast than the creepy villain. Its paranoia at its best.  Easily a scifi classic for years to come. 	2
3168	Ex Machina	interesting	2
3169	It	2+ hours. And NO real explanation of the main character. 	0
3170	Black Dynamite	An awesome parody of the African-American Action films of the 70's.  They did a pretty impressive job making this movie look like it was actually filmed in the 70's, with the exception of one or two special effects.  Lots of laughs.	2
3171	The Usual Suspects	Not a bad film, but certainly a very overhyped film.	2
3172	Back to the Future	One of those movies I can watch over and over again. Always lots of fun.	2
3173	Pride & Prejudice	BEAUTIFUL! This is one of my favorite movies ever! When I read the book, I was absolutely enchanted with the relationship of Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy, but this movie concreted my love for Jane Austen. I'm not one much for sighing & feeling like a girl when watching a movie, but every time Mr. Darcy appeared on screen, I could feel my heartrate increase twenty-fold. Keira Knightly is the perfect Elizabeth, just enough snark & beauty to completely charm anyone in her path. Tom Hollander was the perf	2
3174	The Big Sick	much better than expected	2
3175	Singin' in the Rain	some of the best dancing you'll ever see in film.	2
3176	Pan's Labyrinth	"Amazing movie. Del toro gives a realistic perspective of war through the eyes of a little girl. It also does a fantastic job enganging reality and fantasy. 
  The ending was good since it can lead to multiple interpretations."	2
3177	Audition	One of the only films to have made me feel physically sick	0
3178	Avatar	i really want to hate it, but i just can't	0
3179	Short Term 12	Clichéd and simplistic. Everything is resolved far too easily. For all that, it's still pretty affecting. I was going to give it a higher mark when I started writing this, but the more I think about it,  the more I feel cheated in retrospect. 	0
3180	Her	I loved it	2
3181	The Godfather	"- Brando complete with shot in throat voice.
- Al Pacino pre-yelling, going evil.
- John Cazale, James Caan, Robert Duvall.
- Horse's head.
- Train sound = Pacino kills.
- Baptism...or executions?
- Orange = Death???
- The ending. No.

Verdict: Offer not refusable."	0
3182	Primer	one of those movies that isn't meant to be completely understood on the first viewing, but it is spectacular in what it does	2
3183	A Beautiful Mind	My favorite soundtrack	2
3184	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey	Colour me prejudiced because I'm a major fan of the Lord of the Rings movies, but The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does so many things right in my book. While there are some remarks, like a few inconsistencies, the slowpacedness around the 1h30 mark and the feeling of 'over-animation' at some points (augmented by the 48fps parameter), it has some of the best action scenes, humour, background, visuals and music in the game. The soundtrack is simply goosebumps-inducing!	2
3185	Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, Sprocket Holes, Dirt Particles, Etc.	not bad when you watch at 8x	2
3186	The Prestige	this one is brilliant!!!!! no adjective would sufficient to describe this movie directed by nolan. a superb performance by christian bale and a rivetting climax makes this movie a must watch. i have watched it almost a dozen times 	2
3187	The Godfather: Part II	Why did they make a third? Had they stopped, this quite possibly would have been the best one-two punch of all time!	0
3188	Four Lions	Chris Morris. 'Nuff said. Had to throw out my new pants, they were covered in piss.	0
3189	In Time	this movie had so much potential... probably the worst writing I've seen in 2011	0
3190	City of Angels	Meg's beautiful, Nicholas is adorable. Couple that with a good story and it's one heck of a ride...albeit a romantic one !	2
3191	Let the Right One In	At the end of this movie all I could think was 'WOW'.  I am normally not a fan of the vampire genre at all, and this was easily one of my favourite movies of the last year. The story covers multiple subjects in such an eloquent way while still sticking to it's vampire roots. If I had to recommend one movie of 2008 this would be it!	2
3192	Fahrenheit 9/11	Garbage.	0
3193	Donnie Darko	Mind-twisting, insightful, and elegantly crafted.	2
3194	Lucy	Starting with the We only use 10% of the brain myth, my hopes for a good film were already low. The movie ended up being a mix of shootings everywhere, high speed chases and poor screenwriting. 	0
3195	The Notebook	"A profoundly entertaining, and touching love story. Just as good as the novel
"	2
3196	Gods and Generals	No one could even pay me $20 to watch this again	0
3197	Akira	One of legendary anime produtions and many times used as an influence these days. As the animation is simple and low in frames frequency it is a still top class anime, an icon that no one should miss. Beside the GITS it's my favourite vip-anime I use to recommend to any fan of Japanese drawn animation.	1
3198	Her	A really thought-provoking and mature take on the problems arising from artificial intelligence.	2
3199	The Hunger Games: Catching Fire	"Completely baffled by the amount of positive reviews. This is not good, anywhere. The premise is still as completely ridiculous and idiotic as it was in the first one, plus it's bland, boring, uninteresting and dumb.

And the fact that almost everything that happened in this movie was just a scheme to be explained in the end. I mean come on! Really?"	0
3200	American Splendor	This is a gripping movie that takes a not likable character and makes you route for him. Depressing but enjoyable. 	2
3201	Donnie Darko	"It came to me 10 minutes after watching the movie what it was about. Vessels and wormholes, damn right!
"	2
3202	Warrior	Too contrived to take it seriously.	0
3203	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug	The spiders were cool.  Smaug was awesome.  Legolas didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected.  The Sauron subplot is kind of interesting, and any footage with Gandalf is enjoyable anyway.  My main criticisms would be that the love triangle is really forced and doesn't really matter since Legolas isn't with Tauriel in the LOTR trilogy, and I prefer the grittier visuals of the original trilogy. The Hobbit's got more of a fantasy look, whereas LOTR seemed rugged and more believable.	2
3204	Skyfall	The best Bond film to date. Best action movie Ive seen in a LONG time. Finally a film where the camera isnt bouncing like its on the end of a string through the whole thing, and the Villan is just OP.	2
3205	Mulholland Drive	No other movie is as thought-provoking.	1

3217	Irreversible	An absolute masterpiece containing stunning acting, writing, music and cinematography, all of which are unfortunately overshadowed by the infamous graphic and lengthy rape scene.	2
3218	Fight Club	Monumental!	2
3219	Dangerous Liaisons	Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Every single cast member is perfect and blend perfectly together, so much so that John Malkovich was said to be having an affair with Michelle Pfeiffer during filming.	2

3235	Zombie Strippers	Tits,ass and zombies!	1
3236	The Thing	This is an excellent movie.  The atmosphere is great in the movie.. It could be compared to  Alien but this film arguebly depended more on the cast than the creepy villain. Its paranoia at its best.  Easily a scifi classic for years to come. 	2
3237	Ex Machina	interesting	2
3238	It	2+ hours. And NO real explanation of the main character. 	0
3239	City of Angels	Meg's beautiful, Nicholas is adorable. Couple that with a good story and it's one heck of a ride...albeit a romantic one !	2
3240	Four Lions	Chris Morris. 'Nuff said. Had to throw out my new pants, they were covered in piss.	0
3241	In Time	this movie had so much potential... probably the worst writing I've seen in 2011	0
3242	Back to the Future	as good as it gets!	2
3243	Amadeus	A brilliant portrayal of a brilliant mind. Have you ever heard of the great Mozart? You know, the child prodigy that could play the piano blindfolded at the age of 5 and that is now considered one of the greatest Western composers of all time. Well, this movie will probably change your preconceptions about the man. Capable of both intellectualism and silliness, Amadeus is an existential portrait of an artist and a human being. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!	2
3244	Gods and Generals	No one could even pay me $20 to watch this again	0
3245	Akira	One of legendary anime produtions and many times used as an influence these days. As the animation is simple and low in frames frequency it is a still top class anime, an icon that no one should miss. Beside the GITS it's my favourite vip-anime I use to recommend to any fan of Japanese drawn animation.	1
3246	Her	A really thought-provoking and mature take on the problems arising from artificial intelligence.	2
3247	The Hunger Games: Catching Fire	"Completely baffled by the amount of positive reviews. This is not good, anywhere. The premise is still as completely ridiculous and idiotic as it was in the first one, plus it's bland, boring, uninteresting and dumb.

And the fact that almost everything that happened in this movie was just a scheme to be explained in the end. I mean come on! Really?"	0
3248	A Clockwork Orange	Well good execution. But for what ? It's not a comedy and still have no purpose. 	2
3249	Epic Movie	Weird and not funny a tad too ridiculous for my own taste.	0
3250	Visitor Q	a very good movie from T. Miike (better than his last works ..),  if you  like it you will probably like crazy family by Sogo Ichii & Sitcom by Francois Ozon...	2
3251	Goodfellas	Pretty darned near flawless movie. Scorsese's best effort, and Liotta should have been nominated for Best Actor that year. It's a crime that he wasn't. 	2
3252	Thor	The movie is actually very funny from time to time, which is probably the only reason it is still above 50. It is a blockbuster with special effects and good acting from Natalie Portman, but I find the story extremely poor (a blockbuster MUST have an exciting end battle. Thor's finally fight scene is a pure joke, especially on the story level). Considering the possibilities such a production budget offers, I was very disappointed. 	0
3253	2001: A Space Odyssey	you may be bored while watching and use fast forward much in 10 minutes scenes but a must seen movie which you got to study about it after watching	2
3254	Pan's Labyrinth	Pan's labyrinth is a real masterpiece from one of my favorite directors Guillermo Del Toro. It's a fairytale and an intense drama at the same time. It effects you in many ways. 	2
3255	The Notebook	i may have watched this while extremely stoned, but it was a slight tear jerker for me. rachel mcadams and ryan gosling as a couple just, i don't know, it just worked for me! 	1
3256	Friday Night Lights	If you live in rural Canada, think of your local junior hockey team. Not a whole lot of difference on our expectations of high school aged kids.	1
3257	Take Me Home Tonight	Has its heart in the right place and is clearly an homage to better movies before it, but nothing resonates.	1
3258	Boogie Nights	You aint the boss of me!	1
3259	Boyhood	Near perfect. Authentic portrayal of life growing up. 	2
3260	Zombie Strippers	Tits,ass and zombies!	1
3261	The Thing	This is an excellent movie.  The atmosphere is great in the movie.. It could be compared to  Alien but this film arguebly depended more on the cast than the creepy villain. Its paranoia at its best.  Easily a scifi classic for years to come. 	2
3262	Ex Machina	interesting	2
3263	It	2+ hours. And NO real explanation of the main character. 	0
3264	Dogma	Great movie. Very funny and sarcastic. Spot on critiques and plot twists. Well cast.	2
3265	Irreversible	An absolute masterpiece containing stunning acting, writing, music and cinematography, all of which are unfortunately overshadowed by the infamous graphic and lengthy rape scene.	2
3266	Fight Club	Monumental!	2
3267	Dangerous Liaisons	Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Every single cast member is perfect and blend perfectly together, so much so that John Malkovich was said to be having an affair with Michelle Pfeiffer during filming.	2
3268	Moonrise Kingdom	Easily the most beautiful Wes Anderson Film.  It is also the most shallow.  The world is magical. Every shot is filled with grandiose detail.  Unfortunately the world is filled with forgettable characters and uninteresting events. I love most of Wes Anderson's work but this is a big miss.  While technically superior, this is his worst effort since Bottle Rocket.	0
3269	The Wolf of Wall Street	Did you know that wall-street guys are creeps? Oh, you did? Well here's three hours of that shoved down your throat.	2
3270	Gods and Generals	No one could even pay me $20 to watch this again	0

3275	Epic Movie	Weird and not funny a tad too ridiculous for my own taste.	0
3276	Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London	Almost an absolute truth: Sequel comedies are never as good as the first one. The first one sucked and this one was even worse.	0
3277	Harvey	Much Better Than Donnie Darko	1
3278	Cloverfield	An okay mashup of Blair Witch and Godzilla, but the camera work make me literally ill within 15 minutes. I was pissed I had to just listen to most of it, trying to take peeks when I thought the monster would appear.	0
3279	Fight Club	No other movie has been more applicable to my generation.  No other movie has been more thought provoking for me.  And, Ed motherfucking Norton.  	0
3280	The Irishman	Sorry, but it gets old. The chewed out themes, the shallow plot, the nonchalant killing to tunes of controdicting swing jazz, and the flashback narration that won't give you a break-- We've seen it all, and done much better on many occasions, back when these guys weren't only believable as nursing home geriatrics.	0
3281	Friday Night Lights	Over-hyped drama that captures the smalltown hysteria of texas high school football.  Pace, tone, colors, directing all are fisrt-rate.  But the TV show version blows the movie out of the water, so watch that instead before it gets cancelled.	0
3282	Another Earth	Another Earth has such a unique and interesting story, which does not happen to often these days with so many remakes and unoriginal films being made. The film deals with many human emotions, revenge, lust, gluttony, but also has just enough sci-fi to keep you guessing throughout the film. Both of the story lines blend together perfectly, and the conclusion will you leave you speechless. Another Earth is a one of a kind.	2
3283	Snowpiercer	Tilda Swinton	1
3284	First Blood	I see First Blood as a totally distinct movie from the rest in the trilogy, where as the others are pure action/war movies, as popular at the time, I always saw this as more of a psycological drama. I wouldn't mind them scrapping the last action piece, or at least reduce it, to distance it from those kind of mindless action movies, but I guess that is what ppl want.	1
3285	Alien	I might be biased because of my love of sci-fi (ecpessially sci-fi set in space), but this movie is the best example of how to blend sci-fi and horror. Some real scares, the alien is actually quite terrifying, and the casting of Sigourney Weaver as Ridley is pure genuis! There is a reason that this movie can be seen in the countless sci-fi/horror movies made since	2
3286	I Am Number Four	Teal and Orange the movie	1
3287	Titanic	i find no redeeming qualities in this travesty	0
3288	Mr. Nobody	I'm not really sure if I understood, but it's so beautiful.	2
3289	Nazis at the Center of the Earth	mega-robo-hitler; better than Bay's Transformers films.	0
3290	Dogma	great and hilarious movie by the man himself, kevin smith. terrific (and well-educated) commentary on religion and the church. the only downfall is ben affleck.	2
3291	Before Sunrise	Romantic but not in the classic way... I loved it 10 years ago, and I still do.	1
3292	The Dark Tower	it breaks my heart	1
3293	The Avengers	A popcorn film and nothing more. Marvel crammed all their main characters into this film, with great actors in all of these roles, but then forgot to put any real characterization into the film. Sure, if you've invested at least 6 hours watching Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, you'll have some feeling for these characters (you would have also watched 3 better films than this one), otherwise, they're paper-thin. It's fun, but it's dumb fun, and it's way more dumb than it is fun.	2
3294	Clash of the Titans	A lot of fun. Great practical effects, although the chroma key looks pretty janky in places. Entertaining and broad (in a good way, here) performances from many of the actors, particularly those portraying the Greek Pantheon.	2
3295	The Lion King	A masterpiece. That's the only thing to call it. Score, songs, the characters, the message, are all there. It's an undeniably fantastic film that trumps most adult films in emotional impact and heart.	2
3296	Validation	Yeah yeah, life is good, so smile. I got the message in the first minute. The remaining 15 minutes just bored me to hell. 	0
3297	Labyrinth	A great classic. No modern CGI could ever beat the allmighty Jim Henson! If you like this, be sure to see the Dark Crystal as well.	2
3298	Alexander	hated it, so long and boring.....couldn't wait for Alexander to die horribly. Angelina was very pouty.	0
3299	Lifeforce	Whatever you're expecting, it isn't anywhere close. Not a chance. The less you know about this film before watching it, the better. Go in with an open mind, and remember this was made with 80s technology. Surprisingly one of the better sci-fi movies I've seen. 	0
3300	Watchmen	This movie was a bit difficult to follow at the beginning if you weren't familiar with the story to begin with. It was awesome anyway. If I could do it all over again, I'd probably read the novel first though.	0
3301	Kingdom of Heaven	The directors cut is a very fine movie and I implore all to give it a watch if you found any merit in the theatrical cut. 	2
3302	Another Earth	Another Earth has such a unique and interesting story, which does not happen to often these days with so many remakes and unoriginal films being made. The film deals with many human emotions, revenge, lust, gluttony, but also has just enough sci-fi to keep you guessing throughout the film.

3309	Nazis at the Center of the Earth	mega-robo-hitler; better than Bay's Transformers films.	0
3310	Memento	Watch this film. Then watch it again. And again. Perhaps a fourth time too. Memento is a movie that is meant to confuse you, and to that end it succeeds. It's so easy to get entranced by the acting, especially Guy Pearce's, that one forgets that the backwards narrative is even there. When the climax pieces everything together, one begins to realize the tragic nature of the film, and the true drama behind it all. An exciting film that never lulls its viewers into boredom. 	2
3311	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	Didn't dislike this so much, it's fine and I could stand to rewatch/reevaluate. Not sure if being born in 82 has anything to do with that.  	0
3312	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Bored, pure bullshit.	0
3313	Forrest Gump	The movie this most closely resembles is Woody Allen's Zelig. And, like that film, I walked away from the theatre wondering what anyone saw in it to make it worth my time watching. Life is like a box of chocolates and this film is the chocolate with the saccharine sweet gooey filling. Super-overrated fluff.  	0
3314	Tupac: Resurrection	One of the best documentaries I have seen. There is a lot of realism, passion, heart, and grit to the film where Tupac Shakur (tied with Biggie as the immortal king of Hip Hop) narrates his entire life all the way till his death in this wonderful. It is creative how they use nothing more than basic interview clips to do this narration.	2
3315	ParaNorman	A beautiful ending with lots of depth that redeems the meandering filler in the middle.	2
3316	Freddy Vs. Jason	don't watch it, truly a waste of time	0
3317	The Book of Eli	Complete and utter Christian-moralistic propaganda crap.	0
3318	Black Dynamite	I can sleep well at night and feel safe, because somewhere out there is BLACK DYNAMITE	0
3319	Moon	Beautifully shot film throughout, particularly the shot of Sam Rockwell's ass.	2
3320	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Not a sequel. Lazy, unimaginative remake of the original. 	0
3321	My Big Fat Greek Wedding	I just love romantic comedies, I can't help it.	2
3322	Titus	HELL YEAH SHAKESPEARE	2
3323	Powder Blue	vote only for Jessica Biel	1
3324	The American President	Call me a girl but I liked this movie...enough	2
3325	Places in the Heart	Acting at its finest!!!!  	2
3326	The Revenant	A proverb by Confucious states, “Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.” This is a proverb embodied by the perilous journey undertaken in Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant, a powerful, gorgeous, sorrowful portrait of man against man, against nature, and against the elements. https://magnolia12883.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/reviews-the-revenant-2015/	0
3327	Napoleon Dynamite	You either love this movie or you hate it.  I love it.	2
3328	Detachment	Wow - why teach? Overall, interesting move, apt title. Not a big fan of the cutaway pseudo-documentary interviews, but great Adrien Brody performance	2
3329	The Man Between	James Mason carries off the role of Ivo Kern superbly, giving the character real depth.  The ending also reminds me why many holywood films these days are so weak.	2
3330	The Witch	minus one point only because the atonal choir was too much like the sound in 2001 whenever you see the monolith and it took me out of the fly-on-the-wall element this movie offered; plus one point cuz it's an amazing movie	2
3331	Gladiator	Certainly not a perfect film by any means, but it is undeniably entertaining.  It's been a few years since I last watched Gladiator, but it's a movie I have fond memories of.  I can't praise Joaquin Phoenix enough, he did a wonderful job making me despise his character.	2
3332	Mulholland Drive	A love story in the city of dreams. A beautiful, yet haunting, mindbending jigsaw puzzle from David Lynch. A film unlike anything else. 	2
3333	Maverick	Absolutely hilarious, and yes it's a western.  It has the same humor as the Lethal Weapon movies and the unusual setting for a comedy going for it.  If you haven't seen it then see it immediately.	2
3334	Ex Machina	This movie really made me think about tech and what rights we have and what rights we give others.	1
3335	The Room	The best worst movie of all time.	0
3336	Fahrenheit 9/11	fucking liberal anti-american bastard...filled with too many lies and to much rederict	1
3337	Whiplash	"I fucking love this film on one level. Riveting performances and editing. The ending is obviously sensational.

But on the other hand, lol @ people who think this is jazz. It bastardizes the very art form it has been deemed a celebration of. Also, the music Fletcher plays is actually starbucks jazz. The irony levels are through the roof"	2
3338	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Has one or two qualities that try their best to drag this otherwise ordinary movie out of the pack.	1
3339	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Probably the best Raiders flick ever.  OK maybe tied with *Crystal Skul.*  Fast paced action, great locations, humor, a hero to cry for.  I could watch it a million times.	2
3340	Inception	I haven't heard a single person tell me this movie did not blow their mind. Amazing concept, great visuals, good acting, the whole package of what a movie should be like. Definitely in my top 5 movies of all time. Go see it. Now.	2
3341	Whiplash	Whiplash features a fairly simple plot that is reminiscent of 90's sports films (training,discouragement,comeback and grand finale). However, its main strength lies in the cinematography and excellent writing. At numerous instances I found myself expecting the film to derail into a cliche but each time, it masterfully evaded the pitfall and surprised me with a high level of maturity and realism. Can definitely recommend, although the main message might leave some viewers with a sense of unease.	2
3342	The Awakening	Terrifically atmospheric and incredibly well-acted. Unfortunately, it is let down by an overly contrived and disappointing ending. However, all-in-all, this might just be one of the finest horror films that I've seen in years.	2
3343	The Big Lebowski	Possibly the best criterion for measuring a person's sense of humor, is whether or not they dig The Big Lebowski. My favorite film, since I saw it in the theatre at 13. I didn't know who the man in the black pajamas was, nor was I familiar with the theories of Vladimir Lenin, yet I knew I was watching something special. I've made good friends out of a mutual love for this film, and even disarmed my father by working a quote into mid-argument. Quite simply, this movie makes life better.	2
3344	Dumbo	Everyone treats you like a jerk until you are popular. A sad movie that taught me that people are the worst. 	1
3345	American Gangster	It's ok, but nothing special.  The Wire has taught us to expect more from this kind of story.	2
3346	Kids	This movie has no purpose.  Everything it says, it could have communicated within fifteen minutes.  OK, kids have sex and do drugs.  Yep.  We get it.	0
3347	The Cabin in the Woods	CitW deserves only to be forgotten despite its strong acting and practical FX work. The film wants to be The Evil Dead, but fails at both horror (cinematography and musical direction devoid of creativity or effort) and comedy (over saturation of comic relief with no counterbalance). It wants to be subversive, but undercuts itself with its indifference and sheer unawareness of its subject matter. In the end, CitW is nothing more than a self-congratulating misfire.	0
3348	Jupiter Ascending	I lost it at the bees...this was a great example of too much too quickly with zero investment from the audience.  It was like coming into a film that was half over.	0
3349	Life of Pi	Cut off the first and last 20 minutes and it's a pretty good movie. Otherwise, not so much. The entire religious blabla doesn't add a thing	1
3350	Amadeus	amazing	2
3351	Pan's Labyrinth	This dark fairytale transported me back to my youth, but eloquently related adult events and concepts. The visuals and audio were breathtaking.	2
3352	Cloverfield	An okay mashup of Blair Witch and Godzilla, but the camera work make me literally ill within 15 minutes. I was pissed I had to just listen to most of it, trying to take peeks when I thought the monster would appear.	0
3353	Fight Club	No other movie has been more applicable to my generation.  No other movie has been more thought provoking for me.  And, Ed motherfucking Norton.  	0

3355	Kedi	Bunun filmi yapılmasa ayıp olurdu. Ama konuyu ele alış ve işleyiş olarak, yetersiz kalmış.	1
3356	Eternal	vampire tits are awesome and all but this movie was just bad	0
3357	Up	Perfect...  Lovely movie with a great ending. 	2
3358	Donnie Darko	I love that I'm still confused about parts of this film.	1
3359	Inception	I haven't heard a single person tell me this movie did not blow their mind. Amazing concept, great visuals, good acting, the whole package of what a movie should be like. Definitely in my top 5 movies of all time. Go see it. Now.	2
3360	Fahrenheit 9/11	fucking liberal anti-american bastard...filled with too many lies and to much rederict	1
3361	The Fountain	So sad, actually gets you to feel emotion watching it, which is pretty rare these days in film.	2
3362	The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen	Lots of potentially interesting characters are introduced but not used. Just too many of them.	1
3363	Memento	Watch this film. Then watch it again. And again. Perhaps a fourth time too. Memento is a movie that is meant to confuse you, and to that end it succeeds.

3367	Dunkirk	too flat can't really think of much too say, but I guess it didn't feel like a movie, but almost like a documentary. Too detached personally, although the scenes showed suffering of people.	0
3368	Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace	Jar jar makes this movie really cool, the rest sucks, but jar jar rules and I love his jokes	2
3369	The Room	Keep your stupid comments in your pocket!	0
3370	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	A lousy story full of flaws, obvious action patterns, horrible use of music and melodrama as an agent and way too much American patriotism. The only thing that really keeps the film going is all the special effects, which then again at times are so overdone it's hard to keep a track of what's actually going on on the screen. All in all the whole film is really just another unneeded proof for the fact that Hollywood-sequels usually suck, no matter how good or bad the original maybe was.	0
3371	Dunkirk	too flat can't really think of much too say, but I guess it didn't feel like a movie, but almost like a documentary. Too detached personally, although the scenes showed suffering of people.	0
3372	Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace	Jar jar makes this movie really cool, the rest sucks, but jar jar rules and I love his jokes	2
3373	The Room	Keep your stupid comments in your pocket!	0
3374	Kill Bill: Volume 1	All violence, very little of the clever, witty interaction that made Reservoir dogs and Pulp Fiction	1
3375	Sicario	Great cinematography, but the plot is sloppy and the Brolin and Del Toro characters become tedious.   The makers are too impressed by these tough guys to give them any weakness or inconsistency. We are only granted the self-assured perspective of these two and the naive perspective of Blunt's newbie character.   What the Coen brothers do so well, in a similar genre, is to stand outside of the world that their characters inhabit, revealing its absurdity. Sicario errs on the side of fetishisation.	2
3376	Drive	Odd role for gosling 	1
3377	Roger Dodger	Watch it once and ejoy it's slick dialogue and Campbell's performance. Repeat viewings are not nearly as fun or insightful.	2
3378	Babel	I fucking hate this movie.	0
3379	Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story	Ben Stiller is always good - that other guy is always tedious.  Overall, a thumbs slowly down	1
3380	Moon	Beautifully shot film throughout, particularly the shot of Sam Rockwell's ass.	2
3381	Gravity	This is a pretty amazing film, and unlike anything else I've seen... Visually stunning indeed, and packs more of an emotional punch than I would have expected.	2
3382	Moulin Rouge!	This movie is my favorite of favorites. Some will hate it but those that can be open to the technicolor superphonic artistry are in for a treat. It is like nothing else. It is visionary, bold, touching, and funny. To weave the voice of modern music within the cloth of the most legendary den of pleasure in Europe is genius. This movie explodes with emotion from the opening moment to the last note. It is a treasure.	2
3383	Inception	It feels good to see something fresh new and original on the screen. For the first time in a long while I had goosebumps. Thank you Mr. Nolan	2
3384	A View to a Kill	Definitely one of the best!	2
3385	An American Werewolf in Paris	only watch when you have nothing else to do.	1
3386	Stand by Me	One fantastic film	2
3387	Love	Such a disappointment after a unique experience which was Enter the Void. While the narrative was somewhat lacking (just a bit), I think the biggest let-down was the acting performance outside the bedroom, which was of porn-caliber, at best. Ironic, right. If I viewed it as a generic festival flick, I could easily recommend it, however it's Gaspar, and I want more, much much more.	0
3388	Hostel	If you watch this and you enjoy it you deserve to be in a mental institute. Switched it off at the first gore scene.	0
3389	Serenity	Probably not a bad science fiction movie, but since its spirit is about contrary to the television series I didn't like it.	0
3390	Murder-Set-Pieces	"Watch a buff German photographer work out, drive around Las Vegas and kill prostitutes for an hour and a half.

No."	2
3391	Titus	HELL YEAH SHAKESPEARE	2
3392	Powder Blue	vote only for Jessica Biel	1
3393	The American President	Call me a girl but I liked this movie...enough	2
3394	Raiders of the Lost Ark	What can I say that hasnt been said before? Its Indy, that is all.	0
3395	Valhalla Rising	Boring!	0
3396	Taxi Driver	I think I am quite the confused fucker but I do not feel for this. I mean some of it is nice but really there have been a lot of other movies (many by Scorsese) which show a mentally unstable person or whatever way better. De Niro is obviously, as always a cool dude and that made it good to watch. But, why forgive so much on the ending? It sucked. 	1
3397	Lost in Translation	didn't see what all the fuss was about	1
3398	Dogma	great and hilarious movie by the man himself, kevin smith. terrific (and well-educated) commentary on religion and the church. the only downfall is ben affleck.	2
3399	Before Sunrise	Romantic but not in the classic way... I loved it 10 years ago, and I still do.	1
3400	Cloverfield	An okay mashup of Blair Witch and Godzilla, but the camera work make me literally ill within 15 minutes. I was pissed I had to just listen to most of it, trying to take peeks when I thought the monster would appear.	0
3401	Fight Club	No other movie has been more applicable to my generation.  No other movie has been more thought provoking for me.  And, Ed motherfucking Norton.  	0
3402	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	this movie was so long and boring that i died while watching it.	0
3403	Kedi	Bunun filmi yapılmasa ayıp olurdu. Ama konuyu ele alış ve işleyiş olarak, yetersiz kalmış.	1
3404	Eternal	vampire tits are awesome and all but this movie was just bad	0
3405	Up	Perfect...  Lovely movie with a great ending. 	2
3406	Donnie Darko	I love that I'm still confused about parts of this film.	1
3407	Inception	I haven't heard a single person tell me this movie did not blow their mind. Amazing concept, great visuals, good acting, the whole package of what a movie should be like. Definitely in my top 5 movies of all time. Go see it. Now.	2
3408	Whiplash	Whiplash features a fairly simple plot that is reminiscent of 90's sports films (training,discouragement,comeback and grand finale). However, its main strength lies in the cinematography and excellent writing. At numerous instances I found myself expecting the film to derail into a cliche but each time, it masterfully evaded the pitfall and surprised me with a high level of maturity and realism. Can definitely recommend, although the main message might leave some viewers with a sense of unease.	2
3409	The Awakening	Terrifically atmospheric and incredibly well-acted. Unfortunately, it is let down by an overly contrived and disappointing ending. However, all-in-all, this might just be one of the finest horror films that I've seen in years.	2
3410	Labyrinth	A great classic. No modern CGI could ever beat the allmighty Jim Henson! If you like this, be sure to see the Dark Crystal as well.	2
3411	Alexander	hated it, so long and boring.....couldn't wait for Alexander to die horribly. Angelina was very pouty.	0
3412	Lifeforce	Whatever you're expecting, it isn't anywhere close. Not a chance. The less you know about this film before watching it, the better. Go in with an open mind, and remember this was made with 80s technology. Surprisingly one of the better sci-fi movies I've seen. 	0
3413	Her	Banal. Would have loved to be deep but forgot to bring the scuba set.	0
3414	Kingdom of Heaven	The only version to see is the Directors Cut, unless you're a masochist who wants to see a film torn to shreds.	0
3415	Sucker Punch	The usual stuff, CGI ok, story bland. Reminds me a bit of a videogame with exceptional graphics, licensed soundtrack, but mediocre gameplay. To say it with the words of Homer Simpson: Booooooring!. Nothing to add.	1
3416	Shaun of the Dead	funny, heart-warming, pitch perfect	2
3417	The Lake House	Interesting story. Sandra make a very good role, but I think, These is not role for Keanu. I feel, he didn' find himself in these guy. Movie is in the middle a little bit slow, but still very good for sunday rainy afternoon. Dicent drama	2
3418	Amadeus	amazing	2
3419	Pan's Labyrinth	This dark fairytale transported me back to my youth, but eloquently related adult events and concepts. The visuals and audio were breathtaking.	2
3420	Places in the Heart	Acting at its finest!!!!  	2
3421	The Revenant	A proverb by Confucious states, “Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.” This is a proverb embodied by the perilous journey undertaken in Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant, a powerful, gorgeous, sorrowful portrait of man against man, against nature, and against the elements. https://magnolia12883.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/reviews-the-revenant-2015/	0
3422	Napoleon Dynamite	You either love this movie or you hate it.  I love it.	2
3423	Detachment	Wow - why teach? Overall, interesting move, apt title. Not a big fan of the cutaway pseudo-documentary interviews, but great Adrien Brody performance	2
3424	The Man Between	James Mason carries off the role of Ivo Kern superbly, giving the character real depth.  The ending also reminds me why many holywood films these days are so weak.	2
3425	Dead Silence	yarısında kapattım.	1
3426	Hero	Beautiful visuals - just flies you through some of the most amazing scenes ever seen.	2
3427	Breathless	Under no circumstances don't mix this 1960 French New Wave masterpiece - À bout de souffle by Jean-Luc Godard - with the 1983 Richard Gere remake. À bout de souffle changed the face of the cinema in so many aspects it's hard to imagine many others alike. Jump-cuts, to point one example, was considered as a mistake when this movie was released to the screens. Thus, along with making À bout de souffle Godard had also invented the video clip. Seberg and Belmondo make you want to fall in love.	0
3428	Mary Poppins	One of the best movies ever made. And not just amongst the kids movies. Julie Andrews is so great, as well as Dyck van Dyke. The special effects are gorgeous, the soundtrack also. Must-see.	2
3429	Vertigo	the main woman has really irritating eye brows. 	0
3430	Taxi Driver	I think I am quite the confused fucker but I do not feel for this. I mean some of it is nice but really there have been a lot of other movies (many by Scorsese) which show a mentally unstable person or whatever way better. De Niro is obviously, as always a cool dude and that made it good to watch. But, why forgive so much on the ending? It sucked. 	1
3431	Lost in Translation	didn't see what all the fuss was about	1
3432	Dogma	great and hilarious movie by the man himself, kevin smith. terrific (and well-educated) commentary on religion and the church. the only downfall is ben affleck.	2
3433	Before Sunrise	Romantic but not in the classic way... I loved it 10 years ago, and I still do.	1
3434	The Dark Tower	it breaks my heart	1
3435	The Avengers	A popcorn film and nothing more. Marvel crammed all their main characters into this film, with great actors in all of these roles, but then forgot to put any real characterization into the film. Sure, if you've invested at least 6 hours watching Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, you'll have some feeling for these characters (you would have also watched 3 better films than this one), otherwise, they're paper-thin. It's fun, but it's dumb fun, and it's way more dumb than it is fun.	2
3436	Clash of the Titans	A lot of fun. Great practical effects, although the chroma key looks pretty janky in places. Entertaining and broad (in a good way, here) performances from many of the actors, particularly those portraying the Greek Pantheon.	2
3437	The Lion King	A masterpiece. That's the only thing to call it. Score, songs, the characters, the message, are all there. It's an undeniably fantastic film that trumps most adult films in emotional impact and heart.	2
3438	Validation	Yeah yeah, life is good, so smile. I got the message in the first minute. The remaining 15 minutes just bored me to hell. 	0
3439	Labyrinth	A great classic. No modern CGI could ever beat the allmighty Jim Henson! If you like this, be sure to see the Dark Crystal as well.	2
3440	Cowboys & Aliens	This movie was a nightmarish abomination that gave me a headache and a mild memory loss.	0
3441	Pan's Labyrinth	This is one of the most interesting films out there. From the playful and erey soundtrack, to the detailed creatures del toro creates this movie is magically. It has the feel of a fairy tale with the relevant history of a hostile time in many ways of each character within in the movie. Del Toro created a beautiful movie period! 	2
3442	Catwoman	ok this movie was also pretty dumb. update: hilariously dumb. 	0
3443	Short Circuit 2	How can I be objective? This was one of my favourite childhood movies	2
3444	Murder-Set-Pieces	"Watch a buff German photographer work out, drive around Las Vegas and kill prostitutes for an hour and a half.

No."	2
3445	The Dark Knight Rises	I don't even care, I loved every minute of it.	2
3446	The Big Lebowski	Issgud	1
3447	Whiplash	"I fucking love this film on one level. Riveting performances and editing. The ending is obviously sensational.

But on the other hand, lol @ people who think this is jazz. It bastardizes the very art form it has been deemed a celebration of. Also, the music Fletcher plays is actually starbucks jazz. The irony levels are through the roof"	2
3448	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Has one or two qualities that try their best to drag this otherwise ordinary movie out of the pack.	1
3449	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Probably the best Raiders flick ever.  OK maybe tied with *Crystal Skul.*  Fast paced action, great locations, humor, a hero to cry for.  I could watch it a million times.	2
3450	The Fountain	So sad, actually gets you to feel emotion watching it, which is pretty rare these days in film.	2
3451	The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen	Lots of potentially interesting characters are introduced but not used. Just too many of them.	1
3452	Memento	Watch this film. Then watch it again. And again. Perhaps a fourth time too. Memento is a movie that is meant to confuse you, and to that end it succeeds. It's so easy to get entranced by the acting, especially Guy Pearce's, that one forgets that the backwards narrative is even there. When the climax pieces everything together, one begins to realize the tragic nature of the film, and the true drama behind it all. An exciting film that never lulls its viewers into boredom. 	2
3453	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	Didn't dislike this so much, it's fine and I could stand to rewatch/reevaluate. Not sure if being born in 82 has anything to do with that.  	0
3454	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Bored, pure bullshit.	0
3455	Forrest Gump	The movie this most closely resembles is Woody Allen's Zelig. And, like that film, I walked away from the theatre wondering what anyone saw in it to make it worth my time watching. Life is like a box of chocolates and this film is the chocolate with the saccharine sweet gooey filling. Super-overrated fluff.  	0
3456	Tupac: Resurrection	One of the best documentaries I have seen. There is a lot of realism, passion, heart, and grit to the film where Tupac Shakur (tied with Biggie as the immortal king of Hip Hop) narrates his entire life all the way till his death in this wonderful. It is creative how they use nothing more than basic interview clips to do this narration.	2
3457	ParaNorman	A beautiful ending with lots of depth that redeems the meandering filler in the middle.	2
3458	Freddy Vs. Jason	don't watch it, truly a waste of time	0
3459	The Book of Eli	Complete and utter Christian-moralistic propaganda crap.	0
3460	The Artist	The audience at the showing I attended was gripped from start to finish. It felt like going back in time to the golden age of cinema, the wonder of watching a film on the big screen. Surprisingly moving, had me biting my nails a bit at one point, and always luminous and delightfully funny. They don't make them like this any more - except they just did!	2
3461	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	A lousy story full of flaws, obvious action patterns, horrible use of music and melodrama as an agent and way too much American patriotism. The only thing that really keeps the film going is all the special effects, which then again at times are so overdone it's hard to keep a track of what's actually going on on the screen. All in all the whole film is really just another unneeded proof for the fact that Hollywood-sequels usually suck, no matter how good or bad the original maybe was.	0
3462	Dunkirk	too flat can't really think of much too say, but I guess it didn't feel like a movie, but almost like a documentary. Too detached personally, although the scenes showed suffering of people.	0
3463	Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace	Jar jar makes this movie really cool, the rest sucks, but jar jar rules and I love his jokes	2
3464	The Room	Keep your stupid comments in your pocket!	0
3465	Kill Bill: Volume 1	All violence, very little of the clever, witty interaction that made Reservoir dogs and Pulp Fiction	1
3466	Sicario	Great cinematography, but the plot is sloppy and the Brolin and Del Toro characters become tedious.   The makers are too impressed by these tough guys to give them any weakness or inconsistency. We are only granted the self-assured perspective of these two and the naive perspective of Blunt's newbie character.   What the Coen brothers do so well, in a similar genre, is to stand outside of the world that their characters inhabit, revealing its absurdity. Sicario errs on the side of fetishisation.	2
3467	Drive	Odd role for gosling 	1
3468	Roger Dodger	Watch it once and ejoy it's slick dialogue and Campbell's performance. Repeat viewings are not nearly as fun or insightful.	2
3469	Babel	I fucking hate this movie.	0
3470	Amélie	one of the most overrated movies, there is nothing special about this movie...	0
3471	Dunston Checks In	Dunston checks in, and I CHECK OUT THANK YOU GOOD DAY SIR	2
3472	The Irishman	Sorry, but it gets old. The chewed out themes, the shallow plot, the nonchalant killing to tunes of controdicting swing jazz, and the flashback narration that won't give you a break-- We've seen it all, and done much better on many occasions, back when these guys weren't only believable as nursing home geriatrics.	0
3473	Friday Night Lights	Over-hyped drama that captures the smalltown hysteria of texas high school football.  Pace, tone, colors, directing all are fisrt-rate.  But the TV show version blows the movie out of the water, so watch that instead before it gets cancelled.	0
3474	A River Runs Through It	Coming in 2007: A River of Blood Runs Through It: This Time It's Personal	1
3475	S.W.A.T.	Nothing great or memorable, but it's a good solid watchable action film.	2
3476	Wayne's World 2	You'll laugh again. You'll cry again. You'll hurl again. It's almost as good as WW, definately a must-watch if you like the first part.	2
3477	Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)	Human Centipede II is awful. It's everything the first Human Centipede should have been.	0
3478	Half Baked	Dumb humor, dumb crackheads.	0
3479	Raiders of the Lost Ark	One of the best movie of all time	2
3480	Watchmen	This movie was a bit difficult to follow at the beginning if you weren't familiar with the story to begin with. It was awesome anyway. If I could do it all over again, I'd probably read the novel first though.	0
3481	Kingdom of Heaven	The directors cut is a very fine movie and I implore all to give it a watch if you found any merit in the theatrical cut. 	2
3482	Dumb and Dumber	Mock. Yeah. Ing. Yeah. Bird. Yeah.	2
3483	The Silence of the Lambs	I rated it 100. Because on my scale that's mind blowing. And that is what this movie was. Gosh.	2
3484	Fight Club	Another favourite. The narration throughout the film is brilliant alongwith the script. Recommended to everyone. Cool.	0
3485	Alien: Resurrection	My favourite Alien movie.	0
3486	Speed Racer	An underrated classic that will be taught in film schools 5 years from now. Tight narrative and hyperstimulating visuals cradle an enourmous heart. Take it from a 30 year old that hated the original cartoon: Speed Racer is what cinema is all about.	2
3487	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	quite stunning.....	2
3488	Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives	i can't see any qualities in this film.	1
3489	Chappie	blomkamp once again deletes all memory of hollywood-junk, replaces it with classy-A perfectness. A lovely film, carries it all that one genre of this film can deliver.	1
3490	Dunkirk	too flat can't really think of much too say, but I guess it didn't feel like a movie, but almost like a documentary. Too detached personally, although the scenes showed suffering of people.	0

3497	Babel	I fucking hate this movie.	0
3498	Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story	Ben Stiller is always good - that other guy is always tedious.  Overall, a thumbs slowly down	1
3499	Full Metal Jacket	such a good movie! it starts off kinda funny, in boot camp. but once private pyle shoots the DI it becomes a serious movie. and has some very intense moments. i just love stanley kubrick 	2
3500	Labyrinth	A great classic. No modern CGI could ever beat the allmighty Jim Henson! If you like this, be sure to see the Dark Crystal as well.	2
3501	Alexander	hated it, so long and boring.....couldn't wait for Alexander to die horribly. Angelina was very pouty.	0
3502	Lifeforce	Whatever you're expecting, it isn't anywhere close. Not a chance. The less you know about this film before watching it, the better. Go in with an open mind, and remember this was made with 80s technology. Surprisingly one of the better sci-fi movies I've seen. 	0
3503	Her	Banal. Would have loved to be deep but forgot to bring the scuba set.	0
3504	Zootopia	In Zootopia leben alle Tiere friedlich miteinander (vermutlich alle vegan!). Es ist eine Welt ohne Menschen, ausschliesslich mit Tieren bevölkert, die wiederum vermenschlicht sind. Die archaischen Gesetze des Dschungels sind zwar überwunden, aber immer noch gibt es Vorurteile - sogar in Zootopia... mehr auf cinegeek.de	1
3505	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	THIS MOVIE FLEW MY WIG, SNAPPED MY NECK, STOLE MY KNEECAPS. SO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!	0
3506	Lethal Weapon 2	Most memorable line...Joe Peschi giving them advice about the drive thru that they should always order at the counter because they fuck you at the drive thru...Which is true...Also bad guy saying diplomatic immunity laughing so hard mocking the cops and Danny Glover just shoots him anyways saying it's just been revoked.	1
3507	The Hateful Eight	9/9	1
3508	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	This movie was outstanding, It's quirky, it's funny and it's very moving. The best animated film I've ever seen.	2
3509	Irreversible	Rectum?  Damn near killed 'em!  Man, that joke never gets old.  Rape Scene Rating: 9.8	0
3510	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	This movie was outstanding, It's quirky, it's funny and it's very moving. The best animated film I've ever seen.	2
3511	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	19.12.2016, Cinemaximum ANKAmall	1
3512	Aquaman	Great story with amazing visuals. But, alas... there was a magical MacGuffin and the film just felt so LONG. It was still great regardless. 	2
3513	I, Tonya	While it has a lot of the hallmarks and trappings of a standard biopic, the subject matter and interesting creative choices really make this one stand out. Amazing performances,a truly intense and heartbreaking sit, also painfully relatable to anyone who has ever felt that their best would never been good enough	2
3514	Her	Joaquin Phoenix is a gift and he carries this movie with expertise.	2
3515	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	This is one of the first movie from the return of the very talented robert downey jr. and it's so good. 	2
3516	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Rian Johnson you suck! This movie was complete bullcrap! Luke dies, bad jokes, and overall dumb story that rips off Episode V.	0
3517	Ex Machina	You've seen all this A.I. stuff before. But never like this. Garland is hot for ethical shop talk on what defines humanity or lack of same. 	0
3518	Swiss Army Man	I've never liked a movie so much while feeling uncomfortable recommending it to anyone.	2
3519	Moonlight	The way this movie is shot perfectly expresses the isolation Chiron feels in all 3 depicted parts of his life. The third chapter was especially powerful as he reconnects with an old friend and visits his mother.	2
3520	28 Days Later	A twist on the zombie movie that, end the end, ends up being pretty run-of-the-mill.  Ending was sub par.	0
3521	City of God	It is impossible to hate this movie. Meirelles deseved the Oscar.	0
3522	Battle in Heaven	arzu nesnesine giden bütün yollar sınıfsal/kültürel olarak tıkalı olan marcos, ona yaklaşmak için bir hayal sahnesine sığınır (butik) ama bu hayal sahnesinde, nesnesine en yakın olduğu anda dahi ona dokunabileceği değerler sistemine/kavramsal araçlara sahip olmayı başaramaz. böyle bir dokunuşun/temasın gerçeklikte yaşanma koşulu ise dokunulanın yok edilmesidir. bkz.

3524	City of God	One of the best	2
3525	Inception	Probably one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. This Nolan masterpiece reminds us why we love movies thanks to incredible set pieces and it's story 	2
3526	Ant-Man and the Wasp	3D good. Cooler abilities than the first movie, but slightly worse overall.	0
3527	Falling Down	Michael Douglas at his absolute best.  It's so interesting to find yourself identifying with a madman, but this movie does it best.	2
3528	Slumdog Millionaire	The filming in itself was refreshing in a world of shaky chase scenes and fake action... the plot, I'll admit, seemed odd from the beginning, but all in all I really enjoyed the turnout.	2
3529	Snowpiercer	The last survivors of some climate experiment share a never-ending train ride ... until it ends.	1

3532	Snowpiercer	The last survivors of some climate experiment share a never-ending train ride ... until it ends.	1
3533	Wanted	The plot was simplistic, and yet confusing - what the hell is the deal with the loom?  I didn't get it, even after reading a plot summary.  The main actor's performance wasn't great, either.  But the action scenes and general flow of the movie worked quite well.	2
3534	Mission: Impossible - Fallout	Some weak plotting but gosh dang those were some solid action set pieces.	0
3535	Rear Window	People do a lot of things in private they couldn't possibly explain in public.	1

3537	Before Sunrise	A wonderful romantic movie. The characters make it so simple, because the long takes seem to go by effortless...amazing.	2
3538	Day of the Dead	although a good zombie film shows its age	1
3539	Prisoners	"good as acting from the whole cast
pretty good story
didn't really get that into it tho
never really gripped me
paul dano fucked up character as usual"	2
3540	Gremlins	classic!	2
3541	Jurassic Park	An absolute pleasure to watch. The script is tight and orderly making for an interesting narrative concept that also finds room to chauffeur a rather expansive cast for the first third of the movie, a rarity in regards to blockbusters. The score is beautiful to listen too and fits the film well. Special effects look great, despite their age, mostly having to do with Spielberg's care for details in choosing his shots. All the scenes with dinosaurs seem almost flattering to their designs.  	2
3542	Trust	Yaralayıcı, bizden... Sanki ilişkimiz bir albüm plağı ve albümü çalan pikabın eski ve körelmiş bir iğnesi var, anlıyor musun? Albümün atlamaları, kötü atlamaları, acı veren çizikleri var ama kafanda bunun telafisini yapıyorsun. Ritmi tutturmaya devam ediyorsun çünkü şarkıyı ezbere biliyorsun. 	1
3543	City of God	Superb!	2
3544	Jurassic Park	Visual effects that is still looks amazing to this day.	2
3545	In the Mood for Love	It's pure art. Cinema in the best meaning of the word.	2
3546	The Pursuit of Happyness	If you've seen the preview, you've seen the movie.	1
3547	Inception	Dreams, man.	1
3548	Fight Club	One of the best Hollywood movies of the past 15 years. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Mrs. Bonham Carter all turn in great performances in this adaptation of a Palahniuk novel. 	2
3549	Fight Club	A film that has a spoiled twist by now in society, but still stands as a great film that can say something about numerous subjects.	2
3550	Jurassic Park	Visual effects that is still looks amazing to this day.	2

3553	In the Mood for Love	It's pure art. Cinema in the best meaning of the word.	2
3554	Gladiator	Overrated but entertaining nonetheless. Shouldn't have gotten the accolades it received but that is just the state of the academy nowadays. A bit long, but the fight scenes are pretty cool and worth it. Joaquin Phoenix does the best job in the movie you really feel slimy when his character is on screen. 	2
3555	Fight Club	One of the best Hollywood movies of the past 15 years. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Mrs. Bonham Carter all turn in great performances in this adaptation of a Palahniuk novel. 	2

3559	The Singing Detective	Best 6 hours you'll ever spend.	2
3560	Birdman	Edward Nortan is an awesome actor. The film is very strange, but its fun and relentless. Great stuff.	2
3561	Carlito's Way	Al Pacino, Sean Penn - beautiful	2
3562	Waking Life	Philosophy 101 on acid. Very fun to watch even if the ideas presented will not be new to anyone with even a passing interest in the world they live in.	0
3563	The Last Samurai	the last samurai is a 5 feet tall american.....almost made me do the seppuku	1
3564	The Notebook	My favourite love story ever!!!! First love is what we never forget	2
3565	8½	Arguably Fellini's best, 8 1/2 is a wildly imaginative trip into the inner world of it's main character, Guido, a movie director who is hardly breathing under the weight of his responsibilities, his past and present relationships, and his inner conflicts. As Guido slowly - but surely - gets lost in his memories, fantasies and dreams, we get lost in one of the most creative, beautifully constructed and visually stunning films ever.   	2
3566	Mary and the Witch's Flower	Visuals are stunning-- obviously heavily influenced by time at Studio Ghibli. The story, however, had too many unnecessary elements, the character relationships were shallow, and the leads were not particularly likable.	1
3567	The Passion of the Christ	Regardless of the politically correct comments, it is a good film	1
3568	Mandy	Christ almighty, what a ride. A chainsaw through the brain. Mandy is something like if Lynch directed a movie of the Manson Family Clive Barker wrote the script for + tons of acid on top. 	2
3569	Mulholland Drive	The movie is just wonderful and drives you somewhere to the outer space by its possibilities of interpretation. Certainly a must- see. Oh, by the way, Maddox once said that a perfect movie should involve lesbians. This one is a perfect movie, judging by this criterion :)	2
3570	Dumb and Dumber	You'll feel dumb after watching this movie, but entertained nonetheless. 	2
3571	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	The trailer sells a completely different movie. However, the acting performance of Frances McDormand is outstanding.	0
3572	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	A hell of a trip. This is just as good as any classical animation movie from Disney. 	0

3588	Love Actually	And a 52 is generous for this trite, borderline misogynistic pile of Christmas cow pie. The only worthwhile part is Bill Nighy's performance (as the ONLY realistic story line in the movie).  Firth flits off to France and falls in love with the woman who cleans up (and speaks no English); Prime Minister Grant falls for the woman who fetches his tea and then, naturally, knocks door to door to find her; Neeson's wife dies and he magically upgrades to CLAUDIA SCHIFFER. More like Puke Definitely. 	0
3589	City of God	One of the best films of all time. 	2

3591	Get Out	A relatively formulaic, but surprisingly unpredictable horror/comedy, who's greatest achievement is it's capacity to leave you uncertain if you should be laughing or screaming.	1
3592	Guardians of the Galaxy	2016/06/25	1
3593	Mary and the Witch's Flower	Visuals are stunning-- obviously heavily influenced by time at Studio Ghibli. The story, however, had too many unnecessary elements, the character relationships were shallow, and the leads were not particularly likable.	1
3594	Birdman	Edward Nortan is an awesome actor. The film is very strange, but its fun and relentless. Great stuff.	2
3595	Carlito's Way	Al Pacino, Sean Penn - beautiful	2
3596	Waking Life	Philosophy 101 on acid. Very fun to watch even if the ideas presented will not be new to anyone with even a passing interest in the world they live in.	0
3597	The Last Samurai	the last samurai is a 5 feet tall american.....almost made me do the seppuku	1
3598	The Notebook	My favourite love story ever!!!! First love is what we never forget	2
3599	8½	Arguably Fellini's best, 8 1/2 is a wildly imaginative trip into the inner world of it's main character, Guido, a movie director who is hardly breathing under the weight of his responsibilities, his past and present relationships, and his inner conflicts. As Guido slowly - but surely - gets lost in his memories, fantasies and dreams, we get lost in one of the most creative, beautifully constructed and visually stunning films ever.   	2
3600	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Start to finish perfection. Perfect casting, impeccable storytelling, brilliant visuals and exciting cinematography, an otherwise lengthy film goes by in a flash. Hands down the greatest film of the decade and the finest fantasy film ever created! 	2
3601	Howl's Moving Castle	love the story, really original. I enjoy all the little details he adds people might not always notice. Billy crystal is funny and seems perfect for his character.	2
3602	Starred Up	A unique take on the genre that's more of a character study than a prison drama. Excellent performances throughout by the entire cast. Brutal without being too excessive. A little light on plot overall, though it is well scripted and the conclusion is satisfying. Jack O'Connell has a bright future in acting.	2
3603	Haywire	The plot itself is only okay, however the realistic action is what makes this movie the most entertaining to watch. It doesn't suffer from shaky cam! Worth checking out for sure!	2
3604	Alien	h. r. giger owns and sigourney weaver is really really hot in this movie. her character is named 'ripley' while this movie was directed by 'ridley scott'. also there's a recurring boss in the similarly themed metroid series named 'ridley'.	2
3605	Immortals	looks like porn...without the porn	0
3606	Pan's Labyrinth	The music! I love this film so much.	2
3607	Interstellar	Clever but cold. For all the talk of love being the most powerful force in the universe it was a limp, unemotional thing. Tries for Kubrick, ends up zombie Spielberg.	2
3608	Her	At a certain point, the movie's interesting premise started to seem like a gimmick. However, I enjoyed the film's dialogue and interpretation of the future. 	2
3609	The Fifth Element	Perfect combination of action, drama, comedy. If you watch it now, you probably won't think much of the graphics, but they were unparalleled in 1997.	2
3610	Alien	I can't say all I feel about this film in 500 characters. Visually stunning even now, tightly plotted, and superbly acted. Realistic characters fight for their lives against cinemas most iconic monster. Genuinely shocking moments, a 'look' achieved before the invention of CGI that still influences Sci-Fi to this day. I can't see any chance of a better sci-fi film being made in my lifetime, unless Ridley Scott can be persuaded to re-visit the genre. 	0
3611	House of 1000 Corpses	Interesting characters.  I like how no one gets out alive.  Make sure you watch the sequel.	2
3612	Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie	I just loved and adored it as a child	2
3613	Catwoman	Hard to tell whether this is a comedy or a tragedy. Had to roll a dice for this one.	0
3614	Shaun of the Dead	The movie. If there were such a thing as perfection, this'd be it.	2
3615	Donnie Darko	Alought I don't fully understand this film I instantly loved it. It is clever original and gets better with every viewing!!	2
3616	The Tournament	altough the scenario was not orginal, Some scenes were impressive. and for Kelly Hu ;)	0
3617	The Lion King	Defined my childhood.	2
3618	Adaptation.	Spectacular, clever, keen, cool, original and very orchidy with a bloody brilliant N. Cage in a double role.	2
3619	Nostalghia	Visual poetry through the surreal and the oneiric. 	2
3620	Troy	Despite its bad reviews I enjoyed this film, good cast	2
3621	Memento	Innovative treatment of a fascination condition - the ability to only remember the immediate past. This movie worked as a very dark, existential comedy as well. Brilliant - in my top five movies of all time.	2
3622	Memento	wowwwwww... what a bloody mind??	1
3623	La Dolce vita	For a movie I like in concept, I don't particularly enjoy watching this.	0
3624	Wake in Fright	"The road to hell is paved with gambling, 'let me buy you a drink, mate!''s and the death of the majestic kangaroo. I'll have to watch this twice to know why exactly literally anything in this movie is happening but I would say that is a good thing. Characters are interesting. The Outback is a good backdrop. The score is pleasant. But is there any meaning or just a drunk whose weekend leads to meaningless homosexuality and a murderous drunken rampage?

Great advert for: drinking water"	0
3625	Brotherhood of the Wolf	This is another highly dumb movie that I love because it has so many things I'm contractually obligated to love! Historical costumes, martial arts moves in flowing trenchcoats, sassy noblewomen, a gorgeous soundtrack, moody horror, the French Revolution? Sign me up please.	2
3626	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Really good. They lost the way of it during the next movies, but this one is GREAT.	2
3627	Donnie Darko	Cool.	2
3628	Alien	good camera and all, but the fact everybody behaves like a retard, including Ripley, ruined this film for me	0
3629	Akira	one of the best anime's ever made. the plot is amazing. very surreal. highly recommend it	2

3637	Akira	their friendship is as compelling as the incredible world they live in	2
3638	A Walk to Remember	sucks 	0
3639	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	The book was better.	1
3640	Dogville	There is no running away from our animal nature? Like Lord of the Flies, Dogville provides a plain, harsh explanation to depth of human mind and nature. It feels hard to follow up in the beginning, but great actors and great directing ended up with a clearly told story.  	2
3641	True Romance	Awesome, underrated movie, although I guess its gained recent notoriety.  So many funny, unique scenes with tons of famous stars making cameos left and right (watch for Brad Pitts character).  Christian Slater is actually does a great job in this movie.  See this movie.  	2
3642	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Long fucking movie.  Very very intriguing plot.  I really actually liked it for some odd reason.  I like futuristic spacial bllshit.	2
3643	Boogie Nights	A romp. With a brilliant performance from Burt Reynolds.	2
3644	Goodfellas	how am i funny	2
3645	Venom	A great comedy. It is so bad that its hilarous.	1
3646	Sorry to Bother You	Awesome. Funky, spunky, with heart and a good message.	2
3647	Alien	I can't say all I feel about this film in 500 characters. Visually stunning even now, tightly plotted, and superbly acted.

3653	Akira	one of the best anime's ever made. the plot is amazing. very surreal. highly recommend it	2
3654	I Spit on Your Grave	i saw it when i was about 13-14 and in that time it had a very strong affect on me. 	1
3655	The New World	It's not quite perfect, but when The New World works it's truly one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, one man's dream vision of a lost world brought to life.	2
3656	Interstellar	Why does Nolan repeteadly scores under my expectations, I ask myself. Then again, it may be my bad. He definitely lost it and I shouldn't expect that much from him. I will always cherish The Prestige but the rest...??	1
3657	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	I really enjoyed it, as everyone says it isn't as good as the original but still a good flick.	2
3658	God Bless America	Doesn't really have much original to say about its subject matter, and the violence is a bit too tepid to offer much in the way of catharsis.	0
3659	Gozu	 I thought it was just a weird TK film, the ocean is deep. 	2
3660	Coraline	20100112 - Did not enjoy.  Attempts to be a Burton-esque film, but lacks humour and decent characters.  Story is basic children's plot, and the main character is just an annoying selfish little girl.	0
3661	Eat Pray Love	A film about enjoying life and finding enlightenment, obviously made by someone who knows nothing about either subject. I feel sorry for anyone who feel they learned something from watching it.	1
3662	Cellular	Really dumb, but I kind of liked it.	2
3663	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	My favorite out of the three. This is my childhood movie and I adore it so much. Epic story combined with great actors and wonderful soundtrack makes this movie(as well as the other two) one of my all time favorites. :)	2
3664	The Hurt Locker	I m sorry but this is not the movie of the year!!!!! it is a good movie though but i dont even think it should be in the top 5... it made 15M in box office!!!!! 	1
3665	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Great adaptation, great Nicholson.	2
3666	Under the Skin	Terrible. One of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life. 	0
3667	The Lobster	The scenario starts with quite some genius but starts dragging a bit and uses too many elements of violence as the movie progresses. Could have been much more interesting. Had some memorable moments and very good acting.	1
3668	Audition	one of the best of Miike's films. Horror movie but elegantly and beautifully done. 	2
3669	Akira	one of the best anime's ever made. the plot is amazing. very surreal. highly recommend it	2
3670	The Fifth Element	Perfect combination of action, drama, comedy. If you watch it now, you probably won't think much of the graphics, but they were unparalleled in 1997.	2
3671	Targets	Completely awe-inspiring, one of the best thrillers i've ever seen. The story behind its production is fascinating, and for any obvious flaws that may be apparent because of this it is more then made up for by the sheer loopy power of how the story unfolds.	2
3672	Leaving Las Vegas	I actually legitimately love Cage's roles in most movies. Some may be bad movies but he goes all out in a lot of them. Leaving Las Vegas was a case of him being in a role that worked. 	1
3673	Mulholland Drive	This is genius kind of a movie. The movie is like a puzzle or like a maze. The audience have to pick the pieces of the maze and finish the puzzle by themselves. One of my all time favorite for the screenplay. Kudos for the screenplay writer.	2
3674	American History X	Wow!!! an unforgettable movie, Edward Norton is absolutely incredible in this movie. 	2
3675	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	Haven't seen such an entertaining movie in the cinema for a long time. That's a hell of a combination between black humour and drama. Incredibly funny characters makes it one of my favorite movies of the past few years. 	2
3676	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	One of the best Epic Fantasy movies ever done!	2
3677	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Start to finish perfection.

3680	Gilda	Rita Hayworth alone is worth an 80...	1
3681	The Matrix	One of the greatest science fiction films ever made.  Despite the fact that I hate Keanu's acting, he actually flourishes in this role.  The special effects were revolutionary, particularly the slow-motion bullet-dodging, something which has become almost a standard in many action flicks you see today.  Ignore the disappointing sequels.  	0
3682	Carnage	suprisingly refreshing. Been a long time I had not seen this kind of movies. funny.	1
3683	Inception	I haven't seen it in a few years, and I fear that I'm going to have less patience for the exposition next time around. But the layered construction and the action scenes are wonderful.	2
3684	Criminal Activities	Might possibly be the worst ending to any film I've ever seen. It reminds me of Adaptation where his 'brother' takes over the film we're watching and suddenly changes tone with all these weird asinine twists. But Criminal Activities has no metatextual levels. Its just hackneyed crap. 	0
3685	The Blues Brothers	AMAZING	2
3686	Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country	My favourite of the bunch! Wraps up a lot of the original series stuff and opens up the path to the next generation stuff. It actually feels like the crew is moving on with this part of their lives and onto their own futures.	0
3687	Let the Right One In	Best vampire movie ever? And honest desription of life in some depressing Scandinavian town.	2
3688	Troy	Despite its bad reviews I enjoyed this film, good cast	2
3689	Memento	Innovative treatment of a fascination condition - the ability to only remember the immediate past. This movie worked as a very dark, existential comedy as well. Brilliant - in my top five movies of all time.	2
3690	Audition	"Wu... Uh.... bu....

g.....ffsj....

...okay. I watched this without the knowledge that it was of a certain genre. That is how it was meant to be watched. You shouldn't even know the genre going in. Just go in blind. Let the movie be exactly what it is. Honestly, the cover of the movie was a bad choice, and I didn't see that either. I watched it knowing absolutely nothing but the title and I was completely rewarded for it. Incredible cinematography."	2
3691	The Twilight Saga: New Moon	Some might have enjoyed the topless dudes, so I'll give them that, but that aside: Absolute sh*t.	1
3692	Akira	Love that motorcycle	2
3693	The Silence of the Lambs	don't read the book first 	1
3694	The Danish Girl	Shit!	1
3695	Halloween	First I rip your clothes off, then I rip my clothes off, then we rip Lindsay's clothes off. Yeah I got it.	0
3696	The Silence of the Lambs	judie foster sucha a great actor.	2
3697	Akira	While I'm not into dystopias, with enchanting music like this and oldschool anime art which looks rather warm from today's point of view, mysteriousness of the plot and not holding back with characters' fates, how could I not enjoy it a tad?	1
3698	Guardians of the Galaxy	Funny, not boring	2
3699	Leaving Las Vegas	very well done movie .. Nicholas Cage rightly deserved the Oscar for this movie , he did an excellent job 	2
3700	Interstellar	Clever but cold. For all the talk of love being the most powerful force in the universe it was a limp, unemotional thing. Tries for Kubrick, ends up zombie Spielberg.	2
3701	Her	At a certain point, the movie's interesting premise started to seem like a gimmick. However, I enjoyed the film's dialogue and interpretation of the future. 	2
3702	The Big Lebowski	Walter, you fucken asshole.	1
3703	Be Cool	Disappointing follow up to Get Shorty. Not half as cool as the original.	0
3704	Hero	A story in a story in a story. Awesome visuals. Great !	2
3705	One Hour Photo	This is the best work Robin Williams has ever done.	2
3706	Hero	Beautiful. 天下 is one of my favourite movie 'morals' of all time. 	2
3707	The Silence of the Lambs	Maybe didn't deserve all the oscars it got, but it was bloody good	1
3708	Jason and the Argonauts	Ray Harryhausen!	1

3738	Carnage	suprisingly refreshing. Been a long time I had not seen this kind of movies. funny.	1
3739	Vanishing Point	Delivering a Dodge Challenger from Colorado to San Francisco turns into a vigilante race against cops for Kowalski (Newman), various meetings with freaks, hippies, other road detritus and a fine contemporary soundtrack provides a post-60s Manson-esque tingue to the proceedings and landscapes. A succinct plot, dialogue and conclusion to the film mark it out as a classic in the \Road Movie\ genre.	2
3740	Akira	Beautifully animated, even if it's like a 30 minute adaptation of Lord of the Rings - ultimately the manga has much more. 	2
3741	Inglourious Basterds	i really dont know what everyone is talking about with this film, i love his work but come on . It seemed to focus less on an the story line and more on action which would be okay but action is few and far between. And as far as being funny it has it moments but there not laugh out loud funny and there's only a couple.  Some scenes where so drawn out it was just plan annoying and i mean even to long for a Tarantino film. But if you really like seeing Nazi's get killed you'll love this movie.	2
3742	I, Tonya	I laughed, I nearly cried, I, Tonya is a well-told, entertaining story as long as the real life incident intrigues you just a little. I'll admit I didn't know every detail going in, and I learned a lot from from this film, not just about the incident but about human accomplishment, perils of love, and the pains of following your dreams. Things don't always end in glory, in fact they often end in mediocre disappointment , and I, Tonya is a film that truly gets that. 	1
3743	Videodrome	Long live the new flesh! One of Cronenberg's best (and most accessible) films.	2
3744	The Best of Youth	100 degil 110 veriyorum...	1
3745	Welcome to the Dollhouse	Things are bad for Dawn, things are bad for Dawn...(repeat ad nauseum)	0
3746	The Matrix	If only they had provided a decade to make the second and third movies in this trilogy, perhaps we could have had another LOTR quality set of films. Superb, mind-blowing, amazing film. One of the best of all time.	2
3747	Roma	a heart touching and picturesque autobiographical masterpiece from alfonso cuaron. on the background of a middle class mexico city family, it shows daily life and political climate of mexico in early 70's. 	2
3748	Step Brothers	over rated comedy 	1
3749	Under the Skin	Really liked the mica levi soundtrack 	2

3751	The Tree of Life	just speechless ...	1
3752	Animal Factory	Prison Break kadar surukleyici olmasada guzel bir bagimsiz hapishane filmi..Steve Buscemi yer yer kalitesini hissetiriyor..	1
3753	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	this film was made with such love and time that it is the best film ever i really take my hat off to everyone who worked on the film its a long film when you put all 3 films together but no matter how much time i spend watchin it i always enjoy them i really get into these films i just wish there was more to be made.	2
3754	Man on Fire	The promising beginning is let down by a  lack of plot in the middle, prefering to showcase thuggery and violence.  However, the final part of the film manages to reel the viewer back and you forgive most of the dumbfoundedness - I actually like it! Must mention Dakota Fanning who is brilliant in this picture.	2
3755	Armenian Genocide	"I didn't and will never watch this nonsense. Looking at its title and summary info, it's clearly a propagation movie, doc or whatever. 

Do not fool people with your ridiculous lies, do not use cinema in behalf of your dirty aims.

I am  really too sad to see these names under cast info: Ed Harris, Jared Leto,  Natalie Portman, Orlando Bloom... What a shame..."	0
3756	Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy	There are movies that are bad because the fail to entertain or engage, and then there are movies that actively cause pain in the viewer. THAT ACTIVELY CAUSE PAIN. This movie is not fun. It is not boring. It is pure antijoy incarnate. Why not spend your time pursuing more worthwhile endeavors? Like sniffing glue? Or shaving kittens?	1
3757	Fight Club	Highly recommended. Its mind-blowingly good and warrants repeated viewing.	2
3758	Titanic	up yer arse!	1
3759	The Kite Runner	Highly overrated. A lead character with no charisma what so ever. A strange mix of language! Every time there is some important information without no reason what so ever the characters switch from Afghan to English. Worst example it in the end of the film, where the voice in a very moving sad Afghan song suddenly go over and start to sing in English!!! Though a beautiful montage-sequence of the pre-thaliban Afghanistan.	1
3760	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	One of my favorite Spielberg movies... until the last 15 minutes.  Truthfully, when I watch it now I turn it off at the part I think it should end.	1
3761	Lost in Translation	Character studies of uninteresting people aren't interesting	0
3762	The Lives of Others	"Technically a pretty good movie. I wish the director knew anything about the subject though...
Like many other recent movies from Germany - it was simplistic and left me in a the director is making fool of me state. "	2
3763	Dazed and Confused	This is most definitely a dazed and confused film.	0
3764	Howard the Duck	Unfairly abused 80's classic. An allegory for how America treats it's foreigners, and people of different color (black), Howard the Duck is about an alien (Howard) who is an intelligent and productive being who is abused and mistreated by the American government and it's citizens. People who think this is the worst movie ever are whit and racist. 	1
3765	Raiders of the Lost Ark	It don't get much better than this, folks	1
3766	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	My all-time favorite movie. An absolute masterpiece. Takes my breath away.	2
3767	About Time	Very good film, although it were a bit less 'chick flicky,' a bit deeper and a bit less plot hole ridden, I'd have rated it far higher.	1
3768	Akira	I'm not into anime, but the animation here is a must see.	2
3769	Ferris Bueller's Day Off	Ugh. Main character is annoying as hell and they torture a poor, defenseless car.	0
3770	Grosse Pointe Blank	Modern classic for sure.  Cusack does gallows humor better then anyone you know. It's the movie that made you love Minnie Driver and laugh at a Dan Aykroyd as an actor again and not just as a failing human being.	1
3771	Whisper of the Heart	A charming, almost ethereal film about the exchange of stories and passions.  Despite the realistic setting, it still has the patented Ghibli sense of magic and adventure.  This is a lovely movie, and I wish Kondo had been able to make more like it.	2
3772	Inception	I can't tell you how much this film nearly gave me a heart attack, imagine watching an incredibly intense action scene, then watching 4 more at the same time. This film blew me away, I wanted to watch it again as it finished. Lengthy, and a little bloated in parts, but it felt totally solid. Really great film.	2
3773	Antichrist	Probably the most intense film I've ever seen. Outstanding acting and slow quiescent shots of a director who is in full control of the horror he creates. This film manages to churn up the even hardened people - a masterpiece of diabolic emtions.	2
3774	Ichi the Killer	Asano's Kakihara was pretty much the only thing the movie was worth watching for...	0
3775	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Amazing performance by Jack Nicholson and Nurse Ratched (whatever her name is). A really solid film.	2
3776	Lost in Translation	Sofia Coppola's film hits every note perfectly. One of the best movies ever.	2
3777	The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2	"I like things based on the Romeo & Juliet concept, and I'm usually all for modern takes on mythical allegory. That said, however, my boyfriend and I chose to see this at the drive-in knowing that the series started cheesy(a generous understatement) and proceeded to plummet downhill. It was no surprise that we had to have sex several times to overcome the boredom.

Some of the soundtrack is cool but not cool enough to pardon the travesty of how much those responsible for this movie were paid."	0
3778	Fight Club	You will never get tired of watching this movie again and again.	0
3779	Gregory's Girl	This utterly charming tale of first love has had a place in my heart since I frst saw it as a young boy.  With an extremely likeable cast, an hilarious script and some keen observations on hormonal boys and the machinations of teenagers, in 2009 this film is a rare commodity indeed: it presents awkward teenagers in an understanding, sympathetic manner.  Highly recommended.	2
3780	Baraka	(Blu-ray rewatch)	1
3781	Deadpool	Not as clever as it thinks it is	0
3782	Jupiter Ascending	Didn't quite meet the expectations	1
3783	Dumb and Dumber	I have seen this dozens of times, and I'll keep watching even at the expense of a few brain cells.	1
3784	Beowulf & Grendel	Great scenery, some language and action dialogue issues but well worth the time taken to watch.	2
3785	Cracks	Would never watch it again. Kinda nice movie though.	0
3786	Night of the Living Dead	They're coming to get you, Barbara.	2
3787	Mary Poppins	Dick Van Dyke is fantastic. The children are delightfull. Julie Andrews is 100% throughout. The songs are catchy. And the animated sequences are to die for.  Just goes to show that it's always a jolly holiday with Mary.	2
3788	The Handmaiden	I love park chan wook i love him and love his all movies	2
3789	The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen	More like The League of What The Fuck Is Going On?????	1
3790	Pan's Labyrinth	Although dark in subject matter, tone and lighting, this remains a magical movie. It feels to me to have a gritty existential feel to it, despite its exploration of magical realism. The military tension of just-post-Civil War Spain is well captured (also see El Espiritu de la Colmena). The acting of the central characters is good.	2
3791	No Country for Old Men	No Country for Old Men takes place in the distant future when the human lifespan has increased to a ridiculous length. As a result, there are shortages of resources since there are more people existing at one time. After a lifetime of hard work and saving, old people are forced to leave or are murdered to make way for young people. After assembling an elderly army, the old people revolt and seek to designate a new country so that there would be a country for old men.	1
3792	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	A visual treat, but the story and characters leave a lot to be desired.	0
3793	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Amazing!! Ford is perfect in this role, can't imagine anyone else!	2
3794	The Matrix	i loved this movie. not the sequels. i always thought that the sequels sucks! but this one alone... awensome!	2
3795	Alien	The nice thing about Alien, as opposed to Aliens, is that it's one of those rare timeless movies that don't age. The focus isn't really on the Alien itself, so you don't care if it's just a guy in a suit. There are no hip 80s marines making dumb jokes. It's a slow creepy movie focused on building tension and exploring claustrophobic emotions. Very imaginative and atmospheric.	0
3796	The Nightmare Before Christmas	A holiday classic. Just not the holiday that's actually in the title.	1
3797	Good Will Hunting	A serviceable movie, though not as smart as it thinks it is.  The scruffy Robin Williams character and his wisdom of the common man grates on the nerves after a while.  Manipulative.	1
3798	Peter Pan	Wonderful retelling of Pan, with a GREAT Hook by Jason Isaacs. It gets a little muddled in there, but I sure wish the same people had made Narnia.	2
3799	Mad Max: Fury Road	full action but no satisfactory scenario. İt's exciting, but if you're seeking a good story it's not this film.	0
3800	Dawn of the Dead	Just terrible.. the worst zombie-movie ive watched so far.. the walking dead look ridiculous (blue make-up?). Theyre pussies too, once they walked to one of the characters (with the speed of a slug) theyll instantly hit the ground after one slap on the cheek. Story is very annoying. Acting was okay. Music... uhm, is this a comedy-movie?  Go watch the remake from Zack Snyder, dont wast your time on this one	0
3801	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	One of my favorite Spielberg movies... until the last 15 minutes.  Truthfully, when I watch it now I turn it off at the part I think it should end.	1

3808	About Time	Very good film, although it were a bit less 'chick flicky,' a bit deeper and a bit less plot hole ridden, I'd have rated it far higher.	1
3809	Akira	I'm not into anime, but the animation here is a must see.	2
3810	Donnie Darko	This movie is the closest thing that I think well ever get to a perfect movie.	2
3811	Before Sunrise	I just don't get tired of listening to the dialogs again and again. 	0
3812	The Descent	I would have been happy to rave about this movie if I had stopped watching about 2/3s of the way through, but holy crap did it go down hill fast.  The last 1/3 is just terrible.	0
3813	Deadwood: The Movie	It's like the cocksuckers never left!	1
3814	Stalker	A movie can be at once philosophical and not excruciatingly boring.	2
3815	Woman in the Dunes	Probably highly significant and important but unfortunately also deadly to watch.	0
3816	Shaun of the Dead	A movie with which I can find no flaws.	2
3817	Gladiator	Arguably the best swords and sandals film ever made!	2
3818	Black Swan	"Some may call it a thriller, but that's only because you don't call Oscar-bait horror. 
  
  Refreshing film with great acting (though Portman looks like she could burst out in tears at any moment, which I suppose it the point, but it wears a bit thin), memorable and disturbing imagery, and the most pleasant surprise in a long time.
  
  Best seen going in blind, try to avoid the trailer and other spoilers if you can."	0
3819	The Thing	another movie you will never regret not having seen ...  the first five minutes are ok but then you realize that the characters are all stupid and the whole plot is predictable.	0
3820	C.R.A.Z.Y.	I just lovedd this movie, i would happily watch this again!	2
3821	Inception	I am a man. My girlfriend is dead. There are mysteries. Christopher Nolan strikes again.	2
3822	Black Swan	A dark and stunning work of art. 	2
3823	Suicide Squad	I wanted to like this film, really I did. But it's clearly been rushed through production with a script that should have been through several more rewrites. Exposition flops onto the screen in great steaming dollops, delivered with comic book dialogue that forgets how much more you can show than tell on screen. Everything feels derivative, from Jared Leto's Steve Buscemi impression to a theme tune nicked from You Only Live Twice. Only Will Smith and Margot Robbie manage to bring something new	2
3824	Eurotrip	Awsome movie, especally for first time directors.	1
3825	True Romance	"Classic writing from Tarantino. An under-rated Arquette and Slater tie off the chemistry. Great fucking movie. I haven't watched it in years. I am going to put it on now.
"	2
3826	Euphoria	Very, very dark. Reminds me of Divines (2016).	2
3827	War for the Planet of the Apes	The rare franchise where each film gets stronger.  Visually stunning (VFX are truly the best in all of film), brilliant score, and a riveting script.  The Academy needs to catch up with technology...Andy Serkis deserves a nomination for his work here.	2
3828	Moonlight	Anybody who is interested in character analysis, they must watch this movie.	0
3829	Casino Royale	Sellers makes for a funny Bond, and there are several attractive Bond girls. But this film was directed by six different people, and it shows; I can recommend it only on the basis of historical interest, since it served as the inspiration for Austin Powers.	1
3830	Ocean's Eleven	I love this film for the chemistry between the actors more than for any of the heist type elements.   Clooney's too cool for words.	2
3831	Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle	hilarious critique of the white race.  not for the easily offended	2
3832	Avatar	Unbelievably beautiful shots and backgrounds, and it has well-written story. it is for sure another masterpiece from James Cameron that can create enjoyable 2:45 mins experience.	2
3833	John Carter	My wife and I were looking forward to a fun night out and this movie delivered. Take Edgar Rice Burroughs's Barsoom novels, scramble the events in a blender, season with Star Wars design and a soupcon of steampunk and you have John Carter. If Woola doesn't make you laugh, you're probably a thern.	2
3834	Run Lola Run	Just See it.	1
3835	Bratz: The Movie	I was forced to endure this by my eleven-year-old sister. Don't bother - it was dire.	0
3836	Moulin Rouge	Quite a different version than of the musical version! An awsome story-line, but I like the musical one a whole lot better. The difference between this one and the musical is the main charecter is a cripple and is a outstanding painter. He has a hard time finding love because of him being cripple which devastates him. In a way, I kinda feel his pain of me being hard of hearing and having a hard time find love. It was a sad situation on his part. 	0
3837	The Usual Suspects	Not as good as people think it is.	0
3838	L'avventura	Monica Vitti in my heart forever	1
3839	Finding Nemo	Finding Nemo's best feature is its animation. Apart from that the story is dull, the characters silly and the dialogue trite. Similar to a lot of current animations it lacks any edge, the  bad guys aren't bad and the hero is not so heroic. Sure, kids may get a kick out of it but apart from a cutesy animation I don't think it is worthy of much more.	0
3840	Junior	It's not a tumor	1
3841	Serenity	Firefly on the big screen moves into action and away the quirky space cowboy feeling of the TV show. Good, but disappointing overall.	1
3842	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Please let's just forget this ever happened.	0
3843	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	Hayden Christensen makes me sad.	1
3844	Django	Corbucci's second best Spaghetti Western (the first being, of course, THE GREAT SILENCE.) Franco Nero is an incredible actor, and the main theme by Luis Enriquez Bacalov is absolutely unforgettable. This film is the equal of any of Leone's westerns, and is well worth seeking out. One suggestion: if you buy the Blue Underground DVD (as I did), try watching it in Italian with subtitles. The dialogue is better, adding to the general brilliance of the film.	2
3845	Chappie	This movie had a really good theme and started out very clever. But soon became hard to watch and a bit frustrating. The gangsters were really easy to hate, and it all turned way to over the top and terrible. I enjoyed and entertained the idea of these police robots but it all just ended up being to easy for someone to do something like give robots the ability to have a soul. 	2
3846	The Birds	It's just birds! Go inside!	1
3847	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	"I thought it would be the masterpiece as everybody seemed to be amazed with it,but unfortunately,I was little disappointed. The most annoying was making this movie childish with huge amount of unnecessary jokes and not so well developed characters. The scenario is confusing,cause we get some action and some drama,however it appeared to be not balanced. 
After all,it still is a good space opera,even though it misses some magic from the old trilogy. "	0
3848	Human Nature	Charlie Kaufman remains an excellent story teller on the level of Vonnegut as he introduces slight sci-fi elements into his tales and spins them into morality plays on existence and how we should deal with such a thing.  Human nature might be the weakest of his films, but it still is very funny and proves to be a great stepping stone for this screenwriters career.  Good performances.	2
3849	Baraka	(Blu-ray rewatch)	1
3850	The Bridge	One of the best anti-war movies ever. A great look at the horrors of war, and also an incredibly humanizing look at the German side of WWII.	2
3851	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	ONE OF The Best Movies of 2017	2
3852	The Serpent and the Rainbow	Absolute horror classic. Loaded with stunning dream visuals.	2
3853	Irreversible	The only film that I thought was great but will not recommend to anyone.	1
3854	Syndromes and a Century	Better seen at speeds between 1.3 and 1.5. Took me about 12hs to finish (naps included).	1
3855	Center Stage	if u like dancers u have to watch this one. I accept that acting is poor but u will see real dance! not acting... :)	2
3856	City of God	This violent story could be gloomy, but the narrator who grew up in the slum sees the happiness of living there, and even murder and trafficking feels innocuous. This bubbling society is filmed with gorgeous cinematography, and the camera moves as if it was one of the great actors present in every scene. After a while the viewer is part of the city of god and when the movie is over, you are left with a full array of emotions and thought on all the people you met and experiences you lived there. 	2
3857	The Deer Hunter	No question, it's a good movie. The characters and actors are great, it's very emotional, it's not boring (even though the exposition is too long), but it's racist. All the vietnamese people in this movie are torturers, prostitutes oder gangsters. To reduce the Vietnam War to the scheme of evil Vietcong and poor American soldiers is impossible. 	1
3858	Oi tempelides tis eforis koiladas	I'm so tired to write a review... I need some sleep!	0
3859	The Fountain	Another masterpiece by Aronofsky. This film does more than make you think, it does more than make you feel... a review wouldn't do this film justice, you can't rate the emotion and feeling that you get after watching it. Never mind the score you see here, just go watch it.	0
3860	Inception	The musical score alone was impressive and enhanced the film's plot greatly. All of the performers were top notch. Particularly enjoyed seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Lukas Haas. 	2
3861	Prometheus	Unbelievably disappointing. Just weak, nonsensical writing throughout.	0
3862	Brokeback Mountain	Powerful Acting.	2
3863	Legend	Worth watching just for Tom Cruise's teeth.	2
3864	District 9	Truly awesome film. Excellent acting, striking mirrors to reality.	2
3865	Kill Bill: Volume 2	I prefer this Volume of the movie, as the action-heavy motivation-light previous film left me cold.  This one contains the characterization I was craving during the first film, delivered via Tarantino's distinctive love-it or hate-it writing style.  I happen to love it.	2
3866	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	I cannot get enough of this film, The cast the chemistry, the directing and cinematography are all top notch	0
3867	The Shawshank Redemption	Predictable, yet entertaining, feel-good film.	2
3868	Hiroshima mon amour	In HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR the lovers provide a vivid and meaningful departure for the audience. It is out of their allegorical relationship that we consider the horror of forgetting. She has forgotten her past love while we have forgotten Hiroshima... the former serves as a catalyst for the latter. No other subject seems to be worthy of overlapping with the tragedy of Hiroshima in order to bring it back to life. I felt his vision was pure though slightly burdened with its didacticism.  	2
3869	Punch-Drunk Love	I'm impressed with Sandler's acting in this film. He is much better at playing a social phobic than at trying to be funny. I think this film gives a good description of how it feels to want to be with other people while being afraid of it at the same time.	0
3870	Delicatessen	it's screwy, futuristic, retro and entertaining all at once. I think it represents the Brazil factor -- if you liked that, you'll like this.	1
3871	Jason X	This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.	2
3872	About a Boy	Nicholas Hoult outshines Grants acting, in the way that Hoult embodies the image of a child looked in psychological trauma due to his mothers instability. However, Grant and Hoult manage to play off each other well.Toni Collette's depiction of a mother with mental illness, makes the film for me. Her portrayal is utterly crushing,perhaps a little too familiar. In no way is this movie perfect, but the reality behind the narrative far outweighs the cheese.	1
3873	Shaun of the Dead	Where George Romero addressed social issues in his zombie franchise, Edgar Wright and co. addressed personal issues in this hilarious and heartful horror comedy.	2
3874	Pride and Prejudice	It's amazing how the serie is faithful to the book! The acting is also fantastic, and the scenarios are incredible. One of the best BBC series.	2
3875	Army of Darkness	the movie that started it all for me.	1
3876	Walk the Line	Pure, utter trash. Overrated and just plain boring.	0
3877	Back to the Future	Completely classic 80s movie that is always a fun romp. There is no negative aspect to the movie, its just completely brilliant.	2
3878	Her	Wow!!!... touching, smart and so human... Great play, no unnecessary drama, sweet and innocent... a must see!	2
3879	Miss Congeniality	This is one of my favorite sunday afternoon comedy movies.  Sandra Bullock is one of the physical humor greats.	2
3880	Due Date	This was pretty bad really.	0
3881	The Matrix	Whoa	1
3882	Resident Evil: Extinction	Very well done, much better than its predecessors.	2
3883	Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer	Female Trouble irl	0
3884	Hannah Montana: The Movie	Basically a single episode stretched to 102 minutes of pain, 	0
3885	The Grand Budapest Hotel	Better than I expected! Wes Anderson is hit and miss for me, but this one was really great. Loved the filmography, especially the set design. The acting and writing was fantastic as well.	2
3886	Locke	Pretty much a perfect, engaging film outside of the conversations with his imaginary dad.	2
3887	Catwoman	trash	0
3888	The Singing Detective	Excellent with scenes that sometimes have you sitting still in shock.  If you are looking for that bright happy ending it isn't here.	2
3889	Gladiator	This movie has everything an epic story needs. Great actors, great performances, great music, a great story and a great hero.	2
3890	Raiders of the Lost Ark	"Raiders of the Lost Ark may please fans of the genre, but I just couldn't get past the bad script, directing, and editing. I know I'm in the minority here, but I just wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody who isn't a die-hard action fan.

3891	Frida	wtf eyebrows	1
3892	Shaun of the Dead	An almost perfect movie. Pure genius, Hilarious! Simone Peg is awesome.	2

3894	The Tree of Life	just speechless ...	1
3895	Animal Factory	Prison Break kadar surukleyici olmasada guzel bir bagimsiz hapishane filmi..Steve Buscemi yer yer kalitesini hissetiriyor..	1
3896	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	this film was made with such love and time that it is the best film ever i really take my hat off to everyone who worked on the film its a long film when you put all 3 films together but no matter how much time i spend watchin it i always enjoy them i really get into these films i just wish there was more to be made.	2
3897	Man on Fire	The promising beginning is let down by a  lack of plot in the middle, prefering to showcase thuggery and violence.  However, the final part of the film manages to reel the viewer back and you forgive most of the dumbfoundedness - I actually like it! Must mention Dakota Fanning who is brilliant in this picture.	2
3898	Armenian Genocide	"I didn't and will never watch this nonsense. Looking at its title and summary info, it's clearly a propagation movie, doc or whatever.

3899	Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy	There are movies that are bad because the fail to entertain or engage, and then there are movies that actively cause pain in the viewer. THAT ACTIVELY CAUSE PAIN. This movie is not fun. It is not boring. It is pure antijoy incarnate. Why not spend your time pursuing more worthwhile endeavors? Like sniffing glue? Or shaving kittens?	1
3900	Couples Retreat	this was pretty funny, but it could have been a lot better.	1
3901	The Umbrellas of Cherbourg	Fantastic score and a beautiful love story.  Love the use of color in this film as well.	2
3902	Cracks	A complex and subtle narrative. Green is fantastic as the depressed and oft delusional Miss G molding her girls into visions of her imagined self. Juno Temple and Maria Valverde also offer fine turns.  In short, w worthy watch.	2
3903	Shaun of the Dead	Hilarious!	2
3904	Drive	It looked nice. The supporting cast was decent. There, that's all the positive. This movie was as vapid and soulless as any Summer blockbusting moneygrab. The two leads weren't people, or do anything that a person might do; long staring contests interrupted by gaudy violence with some driving montages forced in. There was no substance of character to grab on to, no realistic behavior, and a song that may or may not have been ironic but it didn't matter. Even fake human beings can be sympathetic.	1
3905	Sunshine	The scene with the planet passing in front of the sun is amazing. Watch it for that, if nothing else.	2
3906	Casablanca	We'll always have Paris.	1
3907	Serenity	A big disappointment after watching Firefly, which is one of the best tv shows ever made, no exaggeration. Too many doors are closed, too much is spelled out, as if he liquidated all that he built up with the tv series. Still, preserves a lot of the magic of Whedon's characters.	1
3908	Drive	Beautiful, gorgeous reflexive movie.	2
3909	Fantasy Mission Force	This is the greatest movie ever made.	2
3910	Deadwood: The Movie	It's like the cocksuckers never left!	1
3911	Stalker	A movie can be at once philosophical and not excruciatingly boring.	2
3912	Woman in the Dunes	Probably highly significant and important but unfortunately also deadly to watch.	0
3913	The Swimmer	phenomenal short story turned into an hour of Burt Lancaster (in skimpy swim trunks) trying to get with every woman in the county. 	1
3914	The Triplets of Belleville	I enjoy foreign films, but the Triplets of Belleville is in my opinion the textbook example of why people often dislike foreign films. It is jejune, contrived, and tedious at its best and at worst it is a repulsive and malignant stain on the current state imported cinema. Not having dialogue and using animation is not original and the few original bits are too post-modern. Its widespread praise is more the result of naiveté and pretentiousness than any artistic achievement. 	0
3915	The Big Short	Engaging, entertaining and educational.	2
3916	Maniac	I'll admit I was ready to bail 3 or 4 eps in. I am glad I stuck with it. All the weirdness and frustrating pacing starts to come together and make sense.	0
3917	The Departed	Sorry, sensationalized violence and people laughing at gore is not my idea of a good movie. I pretty much hate Mark Wahlberg and my opinions of everyone else in this movie have declined ever since.	0
3918	C.R.A.Z.Y.	I just lovedd this movie, i would happily watch this again!	2
3919	Inception	I am a man. My girlfriend is dead. There are mysteries. Christopher Nolan strikes again.	2
3920	Insidious	I now know the reason that I was able to avoid this film for the first three years of it's existence. Fifteen minutes of good film stretched unbelievably thinly. It's hard to believe the final act is actually happening... as it's happening. The tone shifts so quickly it's confusing and annoying. In the end you don't really care though because the intrigue was lost a long time ago. 	0
3921	The Big Lebowski	Shut the fuck up Donny!	1
3922	Godzilla	Ishiro Honda the original director of Godzilla has always focused the films on action and  even though later Godzilla movies have gotten stale they still have never lost their bite. Now with a North American 2014 release we have GodZilla a movie at aims very close to what TOHO envisioned many years ago. The only two flaws i counted are the characters were not the focus they felt forced. The second not enough GodZilla just a bit more of him would have pushed the film along better.	0
3923	The Passion of the Christ	Excellent!!!!!	2
3924	Fever Pitch	A horrible remake of a great british film and book. Go Yankees.	0
3925	Trainspotting	Once I saw it with subtitles I realized how great it was!	2
3926	Nocturnal Animals	Omg what crap .  Who stayed for whole movie?	0
3927	Commando	Typical early Arnold.  Lots of action but not much on the plot or dialog.  Shoot every thirty seconds and make a mint.	0
3928	The Godfather: Part III	Coulda been a contender.	1
3929	Mad Max: Fury Road	I saw Mad Max: Fury Road at the cinema in 3D this afternoon. What a day. What a lovely day.	2
3930	The Matrix	Whoa	1
3931	Resident Evil: Extinction	Very well done, much better than its predecessors.	2
3932	Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer	Female Trouble irl	0
3933	Hannah Montana: The Movie	Basically a single episode stretched to 102 minutes of pain, 	0
3934	The Grand Budapest Hotel	Better than I expected! Wes Anderson is hit and miss for me, but this one was really great. Loved the filmography, especially the set design. The acting and writing was fantastic as well.	2
3935	Locke	Pretty much a perfect, engaging film outside of the conversations with his imaginary dad.	2
3936	Catwoman	trash	0
3937	The Singing Detective	Excellent with scenes that sometimes have you sitting still in shock.  If you are looking for that bright happy ending it isn't here.	2
3938	Gladiator	This movie has everything an epic story needs. Great actors, great performances, great music, a great story and a great hero.	2
3939	Junior	It's not a tumor	1
3940	The Cabin in the Woods	Cabin in the Woods takes one of horror's most tired premises and turns it on its head, injecting hilarity, intelligence and thrills along the way. It's the perfect horror/comedy; laugh out loud funny but with truly effective scares and creepy atmosphere. One of my favourite films of the year and it's just as good the second time around.	2
3941	Di qiu zui hou de ye wan	Structured like a Pynchon novel, with the truth leading to less and less certainty, and realized through an utterly stunning set of scenes lensed with as much attention paid to the poetic details as to the increasingly hopeless plot - all to be abandoned into a poetic reverie of imagined bliss which arrives at the same moment as the real loss of all hope. What a beautiful contrast between the story and the scene, the real and the poetic, the hopeless and the idealized. Perfect in every way.	2
3942	Inception	The musical score alone was impressive and enhanced the film's plot greatly. All of the performers were top notch. Particularly enjoyed seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Lukas Haas. 	2
3943	Prometheus	Unbelievably disappointing. Just weak, nonsensical writing throughout.	0
3944	Brokeback Mountain	Powerful Acting.	2
3945	Legend	Worth watching just for Tom Cruise's teeth.	2
3946	District 9	Truly awesome film. Excellent acting, striking mirrors to reality.	2
3947	Kill Bill: Volume 2	I prefer this Volume of the movie, as the action-heavy motivation-light previous film left me cold.  This one contains the characterization I was craving during the first film, delivered via Tarantino's distinctive love-it or hate-it writing style.  I happen to love it.	2
3948	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	I cannot get enough of this film, The cast the chemistry, the directing and cinematography are all top notch	0
3949	The Shawshank Redemption	Predictable, yet entertaining, feel-good film.	2
3950	Cracks	A complex and subtle narrative. Green is fantastic as the depressed and oft delusional Miss G molding her girls into visions of her imagined self. Juno Temple and Maria Valverde also offer fine turns.  In short, w worthy watch.	2
3951	Shaun of the Dead	Hilarious!	2
3952	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Amazing!! Ford is perfect in this role, can't imagine anyone else!	2
3953	The Matrix	i loved this movie. not the sequels. i always thought that the sequels sucks! but this one alone... awensome!	2
3954	Alien	The nice thing about Alien, as opposed to Aliens, is that it's one of those rare timeless movies that don't age. The focus isn't really on the Alien itself, so you don't care if it's just a guy in a suit. There are no hip 80s marines making dumb jokes. It's a slow creepy movie focused on building tension and exploring claustrophobic emotions. Very imaginative and atmospheric.	0
3955	The Nightmare Before Christmas	A holiday classic. Just not the holiday that's actually in the title.	1
3956	Good Will Hunting	A serviceable movie, though not as smart as it thinks it is.  The scruffy Robin Williams character and his wisdom of the common man grates on the nerves after a while.  Manipulative.	1
3957	Peter Pan	Wonderful retelling of Pan, with a GREAT Hook by Jason Isaacs. It gets a little muddled in there, but I sure wish the same people had made Narnia.	2
3958	Mad Max: Fury Road	full action but no satisfactory scenario. İt's exciting, but if you're seeking a good story it's not this film.	0
3959	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	Quite enjoyable, with some good cinematic scenes. The comedy didn't really do it for me, though; it definitely detracted from some of the scenes. I enjoyed the Kylo Ren character more than in TFA however.	2
3960	Deadpool	Not as clever as it thinks it is	0
3961	Crazy Rich Asians	I found this movie surprisingly enjoyable. Of course it's nothing Oscar worthy, still it'd be nice if the people complaining about the foreseeability of this romcom (duh) didn't spoil major scenes here!	2
3962	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	This is an awesome movie.	2
3963	Beowulf & Grendel	Great scenery, some language and action dialogue issues but well worth the time taken to watch.	2
3964	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	ONE OF The Best Movies of 2017	2
3965	The Serpent and the Rainbow	Absolute horror classic. Loaded with stunning dream visuals.	2
3966	Irreversible	The only film that I thought was great but will not recommend to anyone.	1
3967	Syndromes and a Century	Better seen at speeds between 1.3 and 1.5. Took me about 12hs to finish (naps included).	1
3968	Center Stage	if u like dancers u have to watch this one. I accept that acting is poor but u will see real dance! not acting... :)	2
3969	City of God	This violent story could be gloomy, but the narrator who grew up in the slum sees the happiness of living there, and even murder and trafficking feels innocuous. This bubbling society is filmed with gorgeous cinematography, and the camera moves as if it was one of the great actors present in every scene. After a while the viewer is part of the city of god and when the movie is over, you are left with a full array of emotions and thought on all the people you met and experiences you lived there. 	2
3970	Oi tempelides tis eforis koiladas	I'm so tired to write a review... I need some sleep!	0
3971	The Fountain	Another masterpiece by Aronofsky. This film does more than make you think, it does more than make you feel... a review wouldn't do this film justice, you can't rate the emotion and feeling that you get after watching it. Never mind the score you see here, just go watch it.	0
3972	Titanic	I like the part when Leo dies.	0
3973	Juwanna Mann	Why, god, why? Why would you allow a movie like this to happen? 	0
3974	The Royal Tenenbaums	I tried to watch it a couple of times and fell asleep each time, 0.	0
3975	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	you can't fight in here this is the war room	1
3976	Young Adult	Beautifully acted by Charlize Theron. She should have been nominated for Oscar.	2
3977	Fight Club	soooo daaamn-gooood! a powerful portrayal of rebellion. great!	2
3978	From Justin to Kelly	I thought it was entertaining, I've sat through much worse. 	0
3979	South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut	An hour and a half long South Park Oscar-nominated musical? Where do I sign up!	2
3980	Titanic	up yer arse!	1
3981	The Kite Runner	Highly overrated. A lead character with no charisma what so ever. A strange mix of language! Every time there is some important information without no reason what so ever the characters switch from Afghan to English. Worst example it in the end of the film, where the voice in a very moving sad Afghan song suddenly go over and start to sing in English!!! Though a beautiful montage-sequence of the pre-thaliban Afghanistan.	1
3982	Twilight	The book is anti-feminist, prolife, conservative, poorly-written romance novel trash.  I wouldn't let my daughters anywhere near them if I wanted them to be self-assured, wholly realized women.  The movie is all of that, hilariously brought to life with bad acting and production.  It's the first time in my life I think the movie is better than the book, simply because the movie doesn't subject you to Bella's awful personality quite so thoroughly.	1
3983	Elektra	Ganrer is hott!	1
3984	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Classic film. Everyone needs to see it. 	2
3985	Hero	Exciting and intellectual, Hero raises moral and social issues with its unique perspective	2
3986	Battle Royale	Battle Royale is quite effective on the action-horror front, but it ultimately suffers under its thin plot and veers dangerously close on the verge of painfulness when trying to convey drama, or worse, give social commentary. One to watch with your brain off.	0
3987	eXistenZ	Simplesmente Genial.	2
3988	Bambi Meets Godzilla	Omfg, They killed Bambi! Basterds!	1
3989	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Wildly entertaining movie. Great cast and plenty of action. Very rewatchable and the DVD extras were great. Highly recommeded.	2
3990	The Fifth Element	Pure fun.	2
3991	The Departed	original is much superior, all the things that are changed in this remake are the worst parts of the film, Scorsese has so many better films than this one...	0
3992	Sin City	Brutally violent, yes, but so so good.	2
3993	The Thing	Greatest horror film ever made. Period. I'll fight you I swear to god.	2
3994	Boogie Nights	Roller chick gets nailed by a foot long.  And I'm not talking about the Subway kind.  Everything after that is a bit of a blur.	0
3995	Whisper of the Heart	A charming, almost ethereal film about the exchange of stories and passions.  Despite the realistic setting, it still has the patented Ghibli sense of magic and adventure.  This is a lovely movie, and I wish Kondo had been able to make more like it.	2
3996	Inception	I can't tell you how much this film nearly gave me a heart attack, imagine watching an incredibly intense action scene, then watching 4 more at the same time. This film blew me away, I wanted to watch it again as it finished. Lengthy, and a little bloated in parts, but it felt totally solid. Really great film.	2
3997	Antichrist	Probably the most intense film I've ever seen. Outstanding acting and slow quiescent shots of a director who is in full control of the horror he creates. This film manages to churn up the even hardened people - a masterpiece of diabolic emtions.	2
3998	Ichi the Killer	Asano's Kakihara was pretty much the only thing the movie was worth watching for...	0
3999	The Notebook	Some people may find this flick cheesy, and they might be right. But the love story in this one still got to me.	2
4000	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	this film was made with such love and time that it is the best film ever i really take my hat off to everyone who worked on the film its a long film when you put all 3 films together but no matter how much time i spend watchin it i always enjoy them i really get into these films i just wish there was more to be made.	2
4001	Man on Fire	The promising beginning is let down by a  lack of plot in the middle, prefering to showcase thuggery and violence.  However, the final part of the film manages to reel the viewer back and you forgive most of the dumbfoundedness - I actually like it! Must mention Dakota Fanning who is brilliant in this picture.	2
4002	Armenian Genocide	"I didn't and will never watch this nonsense. Looking at its title and summary info, it's clearly a propagation movie, doc or whatever. 

Do not fool people with your ridiculous lies, do not use cinema in behalf of your dirty aims.

I am  really too sad to see these names under cast info: Ed Harris, Jared Leto,  Natalie Portman, Orlando Bloom... What a shame..."	0
4003	Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy	There are movies that are bad because the fail to entertain or engage, and then there are movies that actively cause pain in the viewer. THAT ACTIVELY CAUSE PAIN. This movie is not fun. It is not boring. It is pure antijoy incarnate. Why not spend your time pursuing more worthwhile endeavors? Like sniffing glue? Or shaving kittens?	1
4004	Fight Club	Highly recommended. Its mind-blowingly good and warrants repeated viewing.	2
4005	Titanic	up yer arse!	1
4006	The Kite Runner	Highly overrated. A lead character with no charisma what so ever. A strange mix of language! Every time there is some important information without no reason what so ever the characters switch from Afghan to English. Worst example it in the end of the film, where the voice in a very moving sad Afghan song suddenly go over and start to sing in English!!! Though a beautiful montage-sequence of the pre-thaliban Afghanistan.	1
4007	Twilight	The book is anti-feminist, prolife, conservative, poorly-written romance novel trash.  I wouldn't let my daughters anywhere near them if I wanted them to be self-assured, wholly realized women.  The movie is all of that, hilariously brought to life with bad acting and production.  It's the first time in my life I think the movie is better than the book, simply because the movie doesn't subject you to Bella's awful personality quite so thoroughly.	1
4008	Elektra	Ganrer is hott!	1
4009	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Classic film. Everyone needs to see it. 	2
4010	Primer	It works better as a Wikipedia page.	2
4011	Scream	One of the greatest opening sequences in movie history. Scary as heck! 	2
4012	The Witches	A rather faithful Dahl adaptation, and you can forgive it for catering to children. Fans of the book won't be disappointed.	2
4013	Super Size Me	I will save you the time of watching this idiotic movie. If you are stupid enough to eat at McDonalds everyday for every meal, you'll get fat. This claim has been proven by the University of Common Sense. 	0
4014	Barton Fink	Best Coen's Film	2
4015	The Big Lebowski	Another perfectly good movie semi-ruined by people running each and every quote into the ground	0
4016	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	Much overlooked film. Well executed, very cinematic.	2
4017	Shaun of the Dead	one of the first things i ever saw pegg in, i've been in love with his work since	2
4018	Empire	would have been better if the building exploded at the end	0
4019	La Cérémonie	Too predictable.	0
4020	Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors	Parajanov's prelude to \Color of Pomegranates\ is badly in need of a dvd release.  On Martin Scorsese's top-10 films for color cinematography.  An incredibly visually dynamic Ukranian folk tale, full of witches and woods, romance and raw power.  A must-see.	2
4021	Ocean's Eleven	I love this film for the chemistry between the actors more than for any of the heist type elements.   Clooney's too cool for words.	2
4022	Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle	hilarious critique of the white race.  not for the easily offended	2
4023	Avatar	Unbelievably beautiful shots and backgrounds, and it has well-written story. it is for sure another masterpiece from James Cameron that can create enjoyable 2:45 mins experience.	2
4024	John Carter	My wife and I were looking forward to a fun night out and this movie delivered. Take Edgar Rice Burroughs's Barsoom novels, scramble the events in a blender, season with Star Wars design and a soupcon of steampunk and you have John Carter. If Woola doesn't make you laugh, you're probably a thern.	2
4025	Run Lola Run	Just See it.	1
4026	Bratz: The Movie	I was forced to endure this by my eleven-year-old sister. Don't bother - it was dire.	0
4027	Moulin Rouge	Quite a different version than of the musical version! An awsome story-line, but I like the musical one a whole lot better. The difference between this one and the musical is the main charecter is a cripple and is a outstanding painter. He has a hard time finding love because of him being cripple which devastates him. In a way, I kinda feel his pain of me being hard of hearing and having a hard time find love. It was a sad situation on his part. 	0
4028	The Usual Suspects	Not as good as people think it is.	0
4029	L'avventura	Monica Vitti in my heart forever	1
4030	Toy Story 3	I laughed. I cried. I contemplated my own existence and relished over my nostalgic past. Toy Story 3 is not only Pixar's best film, but easily one of the best films of the past decade. Children and parents alike will not leave the theater disappointed; they'll be heading back over to the ticket booth to go see the movie again.	2
4031	The Thing	I am still dumbfounded at how a movie made so long ago manages more realistic special effects that CG today. On that alone, this movie must be seen. The effects are more creative than any I have ever seen. This movie has a timeless feel. This is John Carpenter at his strongest. Haunting, jolting, disturbing, and it still scares the Hell out of me no matter how many times I see it. The pacing, the slow build-up, the execution of scenes, and the finale work as one. A master's masterpiece.	0
4032	Mission: Impossible	A film that should be fun is instead convoluted and dull.  Could have and should have been much better. 	0
4033	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon	The most poetic, mainstream, action-romance I've ever seen. The best achievement by a director during this entire decade.	2
4034	Trainspotting	A great look into the life of addicts. Also, features one of the most tense, edge-of-your-seat, sequences in recent history. Good performance by Ewan	2
4035	Ghostbusters	i had many laughs and giggles. most of the time from an old jokes or from jokes from 1984 when the first part was made. If you haven't watched the origin for a long time... well you wont remember all. But as I'm watching it after this comedy of 2016 i have worse and worse impression from Gal's Busters. I would be into it with NEW IDEA, with MORE AGRESSIVE PLOT, with SOMETHING THAT THEY WANNA SHOCK AUDIENCE WITH. Whole movie was like a cheap version of soup you ate at your grandma's 10years ago	0
4036	Hobo with a Shotgun	All that one could want from a grindhouse flick: boobs, gore, vulgarity, shotguns.  The most surprising aspect of the film was its emotional depth.  	0
4037	The Princess Bride	Wonderful take on the fantasy genre with a great cast of characters and cameo roles. And don't worry about the R.O.U.Ses. I don't think they exist.	2
4038	Us	Did anyone see my socks?	1
4039	Raiders of the Lost Ark	One of the best movies ever.	2
4040	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	The movie was so great, the use of effects were absolutely stunning and the story was light hearted. The cinematography in this film was really top notch!	2
4041	Jupiter Ascending	It's like a special edition, beautifully illustrated print of Dune, but with blank pages.	1
4042	From Russia with Love	A classic James Bond film that introduces the archetypes that we know and love today. Double agents, deception, and the first hint of tricky gadgets to come. A few things strain incredulity such as the periscope in the Russian embassy, but the acting and action is solid, and the romance almost believable. A must see for any Bond fan.	2
4043	Primer	It works better as a Wikipedia page.	2
4044	Scream	One of the greatest opening sequences in movie history. Scary as heck! 	2
4045	The Witches	A rather faithful Dahl adaptation, and you can forgive it for catering to children. Fans of the book won't be disappointed.	2

4049	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	Much overlooked film. Well executed, very cinematic.	2
4050	Catwoman	So bad that I couldn't help laughing the whole time 	0
4051	Sharknado	Incompetently lit, incompetently paced, incompetently written, incompetently edited.  And it was done that way on purpose, fully aware of how incompetent it is.	2
4052	Couples Retreat	this was pretty funny, but it could have been a lot better.	1
4053	The Umbrellas of Cherbourg	Fantastic score and a beautiful love story.  Love the use of color in this film as well.	2
4054	Cracks	A complex and subtle narrative. Green is fantastic as the depressed and oft delusional Miss G molding her girls into visions of her imagined self. Juno Temple and Maria Valverde also offer fine turns.  In short, w worthy watch.	2
4055	Shaun of the Dead	Hilarious!	2
4056	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Amazing!! Ford is perfect in this role, can't imagine anyone else!	2

4059	The Nightmare Before Christmas	A holiday classic. Just not the holiday that's actually in the title.	1
4060	Twentynine Palms	This movie will have you believing that we are all teetering on the edge of utter madness and despair. 	2
4061	The Bridge	One of the best anti-war movies ever. A great look at the horrors of war, and also an incredibly humanizing look at the German side of WWII.	2
4062	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	ONE OF The Best Movies of 2017	2
4063	The Serpent and the Rainbow	Absolute horror classic. Loaded with stunning dream visuals.	2
4064	Irreversible	The only film that I thought was great but will not recommend to anyone.	1
4065	Syndromes and a Century	Better seen at speeds between 1.3 and 1.5. Took me about 12hs to finish (naps included).	1

4068	Serenity	Best sci fi movie in a long time! 	2
4069	Yojimbo	Mifune's best, for me. Seven Samurai is epic and innovative and all that, but nothing in there beats the way Mifune plays Sanjuro. Still my favorite Kurosawa movie.	2
4070	Serenity	Firefly on the big screen moves into action and away the quirky space cowboy feeling of the TV show. Good, but disappointing overall.	1
4071	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Please let's just forget this ever happened.	0
4072	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	Hayden Christensen makes me sad.	1
4073	Django	Corbucci's second best Spaghetti Western (the first being, of course, THE GREAT SILENCE.) Franco Nero is an incredible actor, and the main theme by Luis Enriquez Bacalov is absolutely unforgettable. This film is the equal of any of Leone's westerns, and is well worth seeking out. One suggestion: if you buy the Blue Underground DVD (as I did), try watching it in Italian with subtitles. The dialogue is better, adding to the general brilliance of the film.	2
4074	Chappie	This movie had a really good theme and started out very clever. But soon became hard to watch and a bit frustrating. The gangsters were really easy to hate, and it all turned way to over the top and terrible. I enjoyed and entertained the idea of these police robots but it all just ended up being to easy for someone to do something like give robots the ability to have a soul. 	2
4075	The Birds	It's just birds! Go inside!	1
4076	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	"I thought it would be the masterpiece as everybody seemed to be amazed with it,but unfortunately,I was little disappointed. The most annoying was making this movie childish with huge amount of unnecessary jokes and not so well developed characters. The scenario is confusing,cause we get some action and some drama,however it appeared to be not balanced. 
After all,it still is a good space opera,even though it misses some magic from the old trilogy. "	0
4077	Human Nature	Charlie Kaufman remains an excellent story teller on the level of Vonnegut as he introduces slight sci-fi elements into his tales and spins them into morality plays on existence and how we should deal with such a thing.  Human nature might be the weakest of his films, but it still is very funny and proves to be a great stepping stone for this screenwriters career.  Good performances.	2
4078	The Big Lebowski	Yet another film to add to the pile of world-famous American comedies (Hangover etc.) that aren't very funny. The plot never really gets going either - I certainly found myself looking at the timer to see how long until it finished.  Redeeming feature that drags this film above 50% is the creativity in the direction and camerawork. Artistically, it's pretty interesting,	2
4079	The Fifth Element	Amazing movie. It put a momentary breath back into the lungs of what we loved in the 80's and dubbed action/comedy. I think the casting was brilliant on every level. It looked amazing with the help of having an actual fashion designer produce the wardrobe for it. Great original story. It's a fun movie all around. Gimme the casssshhhhh..	2
4080	Beowulf & Grendel	Great scenery, some language and action dialogue issues but well worth the time taken to watch.	2
4081	Cracks	Would never watch it again. Kinda nice movie though.	0
4082	Night of the Living Dead	They're coming to get you, Barbara.	2
4083	Mary Poppins	Dick Van Dyke is fantastic. The children are delightfull. Julie Andrews is 100% throughout. The songs are catchy. And the animated sequences are to die for.  Just goes to show that it's always a jolly holiday with Mary.	2
4084	The Handmaiden	I love park chan wook i love him and love his all movies	2
4085	The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen	More like The League of What The Fuck Is Going On?????	1
4086	Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows	Ister istemez ilk filmle kiyas yapildiginda senaryonun daginikligi ve etkisizligi acisindan çok gerilerde kalmis geldi bana.Evet benim gibi aksiyon sevmeyen insana bile kendini seyrettirebiliyor ama o kadar..Ilk filmde aldigim keyfi almadim.Slow motion haraketlerin ve komedinin ustune gitmis benim acimdan bir aksiyon filmi olarak izlenebilir bir seyirlik.Ama ilk filmdeki Sherlock Holmes havasi yok. 	2
4087	Adaptation.	i first saw this movie 6 years ago and i am still discovering new things about it. 	1
4088	The Lost City of Z	It is an achievement in itself to take such an exciting subject and make it so dull, incomprehensible and uninspired.	0
4089	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Brilliant writing. The Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. were comedic geniuses in this movie.	2
4090	Transformers: The Last Knight	Wtf!? kill it... with fire....	1
4091	Interstellar	Like so many films, visually stunning but the plot is complete nonsense. Found i didnt care about most of the characters and the ending contains a lot of deus ex machina.	0
4092	Inception	MIND BLOWING!	1
4093	The Swimmer	phenomenal short story turned into an hour of Burt Lancaster (in skimpy swim trunks) trying to get with every woman in the county. 	1
4094	The Triplets of Belleville	I enjoy foreign films, but the Triplets of Belleville is in my opinion the textbook example of why people often dislike foreign films. It is jejune, contrived, and tedious at its best and at worst it is a repulsive and malignant stain on the current state imported cinema. Not having dialogue and using animation is not original and the few original bits are too post-modern. Its widespread praise is more the result of naiveté and pretentiousness than any artistic achievement. 	0
4095	The Big Short	Engaging, entertaining and educational.	2
4096	Maniac	I'll admit I was ready to bail 3 or 4 eps in. I am glad I stuck with it. All the weirdness and frustrating pacing starts to come together and make sense.	0
4097	The Departed	Sorry, sensationalized violence and people laughing at gore is not my idea of a good movie. I pretty much hate Mark Wahlberg and my opinions of everyone else in this movie have declined ever since.	0
4098	C.R.A.Z.Y.	I just lovedd this movie, i would happily watch this again!	2
4099	Inception	I am a man. My girlfriend is dead. There are mysteries. Christopher Nolan strikes again.	2
4100	The Matrix	What is the Matrix? A great movie, that's what!	2
4101	Danger: Diabolik	Great MST3K.	2
4102	The Cat Returns	The ending is predictable, but the movie is so beautiful you dont mind seeing it.	2
4103	Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World	Russell Crowe: Fightin' Around the World	1
4104	Cube	Superb psychological thriller	2
4105	Forrest Gump	Brilliant movie about the impact one man has through life.	2
4106	The Century of the Self	It was 2 hour too long! Otherwise it would have got 85 for interesting content. Things to be learned: 1. Freud had a lot of bad theories. 2. We are too eager to buy the new iPhone. 3. Good marketing experts easily fool us to buy stuff (or make us vote for a candidate)	0
4107	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	"I'm still not sure who the villian was or if there was infact a point to this film!
The main character does fly around in an old World War Two plane that had some gadgets taken from a James Bond movie taped onto the cockpit to make an overall amazingly easy sleepy time while watching the 'Action' scenes! O no! Giant Robots attacking!  We need the Sky Captain! Sky Captain then uses grappling hook to wrap robot's leg.... Star Wars didn't do that in Empire Strikes Back."	2
4108	Smiley Face	A film marred by preconceived notions of what stoner and comedy mean in the phrase stoner comedy, Smiley Face is one of the funniest comedies of the decade, yes, but it is also devilishly clever.  The plot is slight and purposely undercooked: Jane eats special cupcakes and has a day.  The movie lies in her adventure, and it delivers relentlessly.  This light-hearted romp is impeccably shaped, each character given their own distinct aesthetic palette.  Watch it again; it's in the details.	2
4109	Pledge This!	why can't I give this movie a -934750873489573489579? This made all my brain cells die instantly. Not only doesn't it have a plot, the acting sucks big time as well and the stars of the movie... well... God why did I watch this? I wanna die. :(	0
4110	Inception	MIND BLOWING!	1
4111	The Swimmer	phenomenal short story turned into an hour of Burt Lancaster (in skimpy swim trunks) trying to get with every woman in the county. 	1
4112	The Triplets of Belleville	I enjoy foreign films, but the Triplets of Belleville is in my opinion the textbook example of why people often dislike foreign films.

4117	Inception	I am a man. My girlfriend is dead. There are mysteries. Christopher Nolan strikes again.	2
4118	Black Swan	A dark and stunning work of art. 	2
4119	Suicide Squad	I wanted to like this film, really I did. But it's clearly been rushed through production with a script that should have been through several more rewrites. Exposition flops onto the screen in great steaming dollops, delivered with comic book dialogue that forgets how much more you can show than tell on screen. Everything feels derivative, from Jared Leto's Steve Buscemi impression to a theme tune nicked from You Only Live Twice. Only Will Smith and Margot Robbie manage to bring something new	2
4120	The Notebook	Some people may find this flick cheesy, and they might be right. But the love story in this one still got to me.	2
4121	City of God	The most popular gangster movie from Brazil. A must see for everyone.	2
4122	The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2	"I like things based on the Romeo & Juliet concept, and I'm usually all for modern takes on mythical allegory. That said, however, my boyfriend and I chose to see this at the drive-in knowing that the series started cheesy(a generous understatement) and proceeded to plummet downhill. It was no surprise that we had to have sex several times to overcome the boredom.

Some of the soundtrack is cool but not cool enough to pardon the travesty of how much those responsible for this movie were paid."	0
4123	Fight Club	You will never get tired of watching this movie again and again.	0
4124	Gregory's Girl	This utterly charming tale of first love has had a place in my heart since I frst saw it as a young boy.  With an extremely likeable cast, an hilarious script and some keen observations on hormonal boys and the machinations of teenagers, in 2009 this film is a rare commodity indeed: it presents awkward teenagers in an understanding, sympathetic manner.  Highly recommended.	2
4125	The Matrix	Jak dla mnie setka ! Pamietam jak z wypiekami na twarzy ogladalem po raz pierwszy na jakiejs wolnej godzinie z VHS'a w sali chemicznej...	1
4126	Quantum of Solace	A good action film, but not a real Bond film.	2
4127	Titanic	yawn...	0
4128	The Fifth Element	Classic, Sci-Fi story with retro scifi imagary and a story line that will keep you engaged and laughing all the time.  Outstanding concept and great/comical acting by willis and oldham.	2
4129	Drive	It looked nice. The supporting cast was decent. There, that's all the positive. This movie was as vapid and soulless as any Summer blockbusting moneygrab. The two leads weren't people, or do anything that a person might do; long staring contests interrupted by gaudy violence with some driving montages forced in. There was no substance of character to grab on to, no realistic behavior, and a song that may or may not have been ironic but it didn't matter. Even fake human beings can be sympathetic.	1
4130	From Russia with Love	A classic James Bond film that introduces the archetypes that we know and love today. Double agents, deception, and the first hint of tricky gadgets to come. A few things strain incredulity such as the periscope in the Russian embassy, but the acting and action is solid, and the romance almost believable. A must see for any Bond fan.	2
4131	Primer	It works better as a Wikipedia page.	2
4132	Scream	One of the greatest opening sequences in movie history. Scary as heck! 	2
4133	The Witches	A rather faithful Dahl adaptation, and you can forgive it for catering to children. Fans of the book won't be disappointed.	2
4134	Super Size Me	I will save you the time of watching this idiotic movie. If you are stupid enough to eat at McDonalds everyday for every meal, you'll get fat. This claim has been proven by the University of Common Sense. 	0
4135	Barton Fink	Best Coen's Film	2
4136	The Big Lebowski	Another perfectly good movie semi-ruined by people running each and every quote into the ground	0
4137	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	Much overlooked film. Well executed, very cinematic.	2
4138	Shaun of the Dead	one of the first things i ever saw pegg in, i've been in love with his work since	2
4139	Empire	would have been better if the building exploded at the end	0
4140	Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia	The acting is disjointed and generally bad, even for a 1970s movie, and it seems the screenplay was written with a throw everything at it and hope something sticks attitude. Western, Mexican Revolution, caper, hi-jinks, romance, bikers, car chase, hit men, buddy film, kitchen sink. All of it and more. Ah, well. I don't regret seeing it, but I was pretty disappointed with it.	0
4141	Joker	Perhaps we are finally witnessing the maturity of the hero subgenre. The mainstream comics universe, be it Marvel or DC, sure has a multitude of themes to be worked with with more depth than the usual teen action movie and here we have a work that goes into the age-old discussion about the role of the Waynes in creating the inequalities that will inevitably culminate in the criminality that Bruce so much fights against. In the current state of affairs it sure sounds like a cautionary tale. 	2
4142	Donnie Darko	Very original. Good music. Fun characters. 	2
4143	The Cat in the Hat	CRAP	0
4144	The Big Lebowski	This satiric, Chandler-esque, film-noir-cum-character-study set in 1990s Los Angeles courtesy of Joel and Ethan Coen pokes along at a snails pace, never really going anywhere, with nothing but some sharp dialogue and superlative performances to recommend it.  Jeff Bridges IS magnificent, though, and John Goodman hilarious.  If you're a member of the Lebowski cult, the film is brilliant.  For the rest of us, it's merely okay.   	2
4145	Happy Gilmore	You're gonna die Clown!	2
4146	Donnie Darko	This movie is the closest thing that I think well ever get to a perfect movie.	2
4147	Before Sunrise	I just don't get tired of listening to the dialogs again and again. 	0
4148	The Descent	I would have been happy to rave about this movie if I had stopped watching about 2/3s of the way through, but holy crap did it go down hill fast.  The last 1/3 is just terrible.	0
4149	Deadwood: The Movie	It's like the cocksuckers never left!	1
4150	Alexander	Definitely the worst movie I ever saw. Such a huge collection of distressig mistakes, unbelievable.	0
4151	Dunkirk	Dull.	0
4152	Click	I was drunk as shit when I saw this and I still thought it was terrible	1
4153	Akira	Maybe not the goriest manga but still give it a thought before watching it unless you are a manga lover.	1
4154	Titanic	a sad and pathetic attempt to show a true world tragedy. the love story is terrible and not worth a tear.	0
4155	Pappa ante Portas	Überraschend amüsant und kurzweilig. Sehr gute Regie! Nach einer Stunde, als die Geschichte voran kommen wollte, gabs einen kleinen Durchhänger, insgesamt aber ganz lustig.	0
4156	Freddy Got Fingered	A brilliant, misunderstood art-house classic.	2
4157	Süt kardesler	Unforgettable with every scene.	2
4158	Black Dynamite	Blaxploitationploitation, and no that wasn't a typo.  This movie does its job and then some, with some great on-purpose double-takes within the flick and obvious continuity errors.  It makes Kung-Pao: Enter the Fist look like Kung-Pao: Enter the Fist.	0
4159	Drive	Too hyper=stylistic and a weak story held this one back from being truly great.	0
4160	The Notebook	emotion doesn't come from sad music no thank you	2
4161	Gangster Squad	Check your brain at the door for this piece of garbage movie. Penn's performance of a Jewish mob boss feels like a Saturday Night Live parody of Robert De Niro's Capone from The Untouchables. I painfully sit through this movie. The art direction and lighting was well done, but the direction was horrible. It seems like the director doesn't know if he wants to make a spoof of a 1940s gangster movie or a tribute.	0
4162	Drive	lame. so many goofs. A 1/2 hour of dialogue and acting stretched into an hour and 1/2.	0
4163	Falling Down	I really enjoyed this film, fun to see what would have to someone who just snaps. Love the part in the burger joint. Also have to agree with most other people, is this the only really good film Schumacher has ever done!!	2
4164	Predestination	Who came first, chicken or the egg? The Rooster.  This movie has successfully raped my brain!!  	0
4165	The Shining	This would have a higher score if Nicholson had killed Shelley Duvall and the film had ended with he and Scatman Crothers feasting on ice cream.	1
4166	The Passion of the Christ	This was an excellent movie.  Very violent and not for everyone.  It really shows what Christ went through for us.  	2
4167	Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie	Rated an 8 simply because I was 8 when I saw it. My 8 year old self was a drooling flailing pudding cup eating film retard because he LOVED this movie. Good times.	0
4168	Touch of Evil	It has been called the last film noir. Perhaps it is not, but it is the pinnacle of the genre.	2
4169	13 Conversations About One Thing	A vry uneven movie, it loses it's own message trying to be artful and clever with the storyline.  But still, there are many great moments in the film.	2
4170	Watchmen	Fantastic.  The opening credits may be the best ever.  Great story that flows really well and surprises at the end.  	2
4171	Dances with Wolves	Loved, like lived, with hunting scenes!	1
4172	Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors	Parajanov's prelude to \Color of Pomegranates\ is badly in need of a dvd release.  On Martin Scorsese's top-10 films for color cinematography.  An incredibly visually dynamic Ukranian folk tale, full of witches and woods, romance and raw power.  A must-see.	2
4173	Ocean's Eleven	I love this film for the chemistry between the actors more than for any of the heist type elements.   Clooney's too cool for words.	2
4174	Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle	hilarious critique of the white race.  not for the easily offended	2
4175	Avatar	Unbelievably beautiful shots and backgrounds, and it has well-written story. it is for sure another masterpiece from James Cameron that can create enjoyable 2:45 mins experience.	2
4176	John Carter	My wife and I were looking forward to a fun night out and this movie delivered. Take Edgar Rice Burroughs's Barsoom novels, scramble the events in a blender, season with Star Wars design and a soupcon of steampunk and you have John Carter. If Woola doesn't make you laugh, you're probably a thern.	2
4177	Run Lola Run	Just See it.	1
4178	Bratz: The Movie	I was forced to endure this by my eleven-year-old sister. Don't bother - it was dire.	0
4179	Moulin Rouge	Quite a different version than of the musical version! An awsome story-line, but I like the musical one a whole lot better. The difference between this one and the musical is the main charecter is a cripple and is a outstanding painter. He has a hard time finding love because of him being cripple which devastates him. In a way, I kinda feel his pain of me being hard of hearing and having a hard time find love. It was a sad situation on his part. 	0
4180	Süt kardesler	Unforgettable with every scene.	2
4181	Black Dynamite	Blaxploitationploitation, and no that wasn't a typo.  This movie does its job and then some, with some great on-purpose double-takes within the flick and obvious continuity errors.  It makes Kung-Pao: Enter the Fist look like Kung-Pao: Enter the Fist.	0
4182	Drive	Too hyper=stylistic and a weak story held this one back from being truly great.	0
4183	Morning Glory	a very bad copy of devil wears prada. characters are very superficial and nothing funny except the roller coaster scene.	0
4184	Kingdom of Heaven	perfect as every film by director an script perfect muslims and christs are equal	2
4185	Deadpool	I rate on entertainment value rather than perfect movie (since I don't know what that is) ... therefore I can't imagine a more entertaining 100 mins of cinema. Laughter [check] Action [check] Romance [check] all done at a very high level. Funnier than most comedies, better action than most action movies. 	2
4186	Bottle Rocket	31 Mart 08 with Burak, 00:30 am.	1
4187	Snowpiercer	One of the more thought-provoking films I've seen this year. Packs the punch of a blockbuster action movie and also has meaning and heart - something sci-fi movies have been lacking lately. Very interesting symbolism and a nice critique of the class system - Snowpiercer comes highly recommended from me! 	2
4188	Juno	Revisited (3+)	1
4189	Black Panther	A standout from the other Marvel films for its excellent score, costume design, ensemble cast, and story that feels like it has more to say. The CGI is noticably bad for a lot of the film, and some of the action scenes, such as the last big battle, felt trite and rehashed. The world building was OK, though there is little that is actually seen of Wakanda outside of a few buildings and some rooms. Overall, there is some things that make it stand out and elevate it a little above the MCU forumla.	1
4190	Notorious	I'm not a massive Hitchcock fan and the pacing was pretty slow, but it had some genuinely tense scenes which surprised and impressed me. 	2
4191	It's a Wonderful Life	This movie changed my life and get me out of depression and teach me I can make a big difference.	2
4192	Juno	Revisited (3+)	1
4193	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Una de mis pelis preferidas.. es espectacular..	1
4194	The Big Lebowski	A comedic masterpiece	2
4195	Meet Joe Black	If I were to teach death what was so special about life I would do a better job! Peanut butter is all they could come up with?	0
4196	Drive	Amazing Music	2
4197	Captain America: Civil War	No it's not Aronofsky, but represents the best of superhero action movies - complex themes, motivations, the culmination of a dozen movies interweaving plots and characters in a way that makes you familiar with them as individuals and their group dynamics.  It provided what I was seeking from it:  a ton of fun, and the warm appreciation of the internal continuity.	2
4198	The Master Cleanse	A bizarre story that requires a major suspension of disbelief but has a very sweet message. If you like it strange (and i do lol) and have a creative mind you will be able to appreciate this.	2
4199	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Refreshing material from an oldie	2
4200	Cellular	64	1
4201	Irreversible	scary stuff, vincent cassel is always great...	2
4202	Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels	also an all time favorite i love the plot and guy ritchie is my fave director	2
4203	Gladiator	An absolute crowd pleaser. This movie gives you everything you'd ever need. Action at it's very best mixed in with fantastic acting and beautiful images. A great movie. 	2
4204	Night Pulse	tits in your face, dial-up in the lace what we've got here is that dazzle razzle baby we're talkin Bill Friedkin down right freakin ok ya gotta see it to believe	2
4205	Manchester by the Sea	Painful, heartbreaking. The wallow stays with you and it follows. Great performances. No bad words to say about the film.	0
4206	Her	beautiful	2
4207	La La Land	I loved this film so much and found almost no imperfections. I expect this to be a favourite film of mine for a long time. 	2
4208	Breathless	Film yapmak için bir silah ve bir kadın yetmiyor bence Godard'cığım.	1
4209	Watchmen	Probably one of the best comic-to-movie adaptations out there. Even though it took some minor liberties with the source material the story doesn't lose one bit of it's status as an iconic masterpiece. Watch the Ultimate Cut if you can.	2
4210	Night Pulse	tits in your face, dial-up in the lace what we've got here is that dazzle razzle baby we're talkin Bill Friedkin down right freakin ok ya gotta see it to believe	2
4211	Manchester by the Sea	Painful, heartbreaking. The wallow stays with you and it follows. Great performances. No bad words to say about the film.	0
4212	Her	beautiful	2
4213	Yes Man	pretty sure i laughed histarically most of the movie.. maybe it was the beer.. but it was definately a decent jim carrey flick	2
4214	Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi	I can see why this annoyed the dudebros	0
4215	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Enestående film fra Milos Forman, som omhandler pasienter på en mental institusjon. Jack Nicholson spiller fantastisk, og hele filmen totalt sett er meget solid.	1
4216	The Magnificent Seven	Awesome.	2
4217	Back to the Future	This will always be my favorite movie. It is crafted with upmost precision, constantly likeable, and manages to balance comedy, action, and adventure masterfully. If you haven't seen this, what better things could you be doing?	2
4218	The Notebook	pretty much the 2nd best chick-flick i've seen.	2
4219	Mulholland Drive	Paradoxal as life itself...	1
4220	Mulholland Drive	Paradoxal as life itself...	1
4221	City of God	This was a very interesting movie about a kid growing up in Rio in the middle of a drug/territory war between a number of groups.  I liked the character development a lot of the major players as well as people close to the main character.  It was shot in a very raw way and I think it had a lot of honesty in it.  It was actually pretty moving.	0
4222	Her	The love the use of orange. Very emotionally stimulating. Makes me think of social issues in the future. 	2
4223	True Romance	Gangsters + gunfight + ghost of Elvis = Best romance EVAR.	0
4224	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story	Carrefour... Awesome.	2
4225	District 9	not so sure why so many seem to think this film has racist portrayals when it's themes revolve around the evils of human-kind in general, when it comes to such things. it's quite a statement against the methods that man resorts to when dealing with what we might consider a lower-class citizen, while being openly honest. good story, believable cgi integration. awesome sci-fi with some real meaning to it.	2
4226	Pan's Labyrinth	Perfect mix of fantasy, reality, innocence, violence, great story-telling, great acting, great atmosphere and pure movie-watching awesomeness.	2
4227	Inside Out	It hit me right in the childhood.	2
4228	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	GRAN ADAPTACION DEL LIBRO	2
4229	Dumb and Dumber	One of my favorite comedies! I think Jim Carrys best comedy!	2
4230	Dumb and Dumber	One of my favorite comedies! I think Jim Carrys best comedy!	2
4231	Thor: Ragnarok	I thought it was very funny and enertaining, a huge improvement over the second Thor movie. 	2
4232	Joy Division	One of my favorite documentary's ever, portrays a lot about Joy Division that Control doesn't. Lets the music define it. Powerful.	2
4233	La La Land	A concept that on paper seems dire, but is carried by the charm of Emma Stone, the jazzy soundtrack and some beautifully clever cinematography. I do struggle with Ryan Gosling (acting and singing-wise) - but overall, easily one of the best musicals in recent times.	2
4234	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	amazing	2
4235	28 Days Later	realist film very belivble and frightning	1
4236	Se7en	Excellent. This is Kevin Spacey's best play. A thriller that radically change the relation between movie and viewer.	2
4237	The Birds	Underrated.	1
4238	Pride & Prejudice	wonderful	2
4239	District 9	One of the best movies of the year. SO original. SO ORIGINAL. Even the way the story is told! Can I say more? A great surprise.	2
4240	Mad Max: Fury Road	I recommend taking a Xanax before watching this action infused rom-com.	2
4241	Mulholland Drive	Paradoxal as life itself...	1
4242	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	The Coens are at their best with this take on Homer's story. Watch for Coen Brothers regulars in oddball roles. The soundtrack is amazing as well.	2
4243	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Feels too much like Steven Speilberg doing a Kubrick film.	0
4244	Fight Club	A-grade movie	1
4245	Gladiator	Fantastic movie	2
4246	Interstellar	although there is blanks and some unclear passages at the end, the movie carries you with it. you watch it with full attention all along...	0
4247	The Rover	The most underrated film of 2014. An instant classic. 	2
4248	Memento	I'll really have to see it again before I fully understand it. But I will say that the confusing structure pays off massively, with several mindf*cking twists and turns throughout.	1
4249	Guardians of the Galaxy	"Simply an action film in space. Unlike Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't pretend to be a super-serious film about saving the world. With a soundtrack that blows your mind while the Guardians are fighting aliens to get the I-don't-know-what-the-hell-this-is-but-is-serious-shit and stop the plans of the evil Thanos and all the bad guys.
A great action film that gives what was promissed."	1
4250	The Notebook	Maybe I would have liked the movie better if I hadn't read the book.  The book is absolutely amazing and the movie doesn't compare.  Great story though.	2
4251	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Great start to an awesome trillogy	2
4252	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Interesting, original idea!	2
4253	Pride & Prejudice	Great adaptation with a beautiful score for a beautiful movie. The chemistry between the axtors portraying the bemmet family radiates through the screen and the entire film. A must see.	2
4254	Se7en	I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please !	2
4255	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	Of course very shocking for it's day, but remains relatively tame. Take away the subject matter this is a sub par film.	0
4256	Seven Samurai	Without doubt a very fine movie, but for me the experience wasn't quite as great as it was for most others, it seems. I found it extremely enjoyable, but not quite interesting enough to be a masterpiece	1
4257	Lost Highway	MASTERPIECE!	2
4258	Gravity	It stressed me out, but that doesn't change the fact that it was very well-done film across the board. It's impossible not to acknowledge the groundbreaking effects and their marriage with the fantastic cinematography. 	0
4259	Valhalla Rising	Strangely and disturbingly good	2
4260	Raiders of the Lost Ark	On my top 10 all time.	1
4261	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	Peliculon!	1
4262	True Romance	86	1
4263	Badlands	Martin Sheen gives one of the great all-time film performances as the charmingly self-effacing sociopath Kit Carruthers. Narrated sleepily by the perfectly blank-faced Sissy Spacek, Badlands is a haunting, sprawling masterpiece that is determined not to judge its two lead characters and, with control astonishing for a first-time director, succeeds completely. Malick is already in almost total control of the hypnotic style that has become his trademark and makes him my favorite director.	2
4264	City of God	good true and honest story	2
4265	Donnie Darko	Beautiful. 	2
4266	Watchmen	Only super hero movie I actually enjoy. 	2
4267	Suicide Squad	Bogged down with hype. Leto's Joker is a stand out along with Robbie's Harley Quinn and Smith's Deadshot. Not as good as the hype made out in terms of plot. 	0
4268	Midnight in Paris	The story of the golden age is pleasant, but Owen Wilson is horrible. Luckely, there is Marion Cotillard to fill the gap.	0
4269	The Great Wall	Not a horrible movie, the thing that killed me about the movie, was the horrible accent that Matt Damon's character had, I swear that his voice changed accent thoughout the whole thing.	0
4270	Bart Got a Room	Pretty bland. Had a few funny moments, the ending was probably the highlight of the movie. 	0
4271	Raiders of the Lost Ark	On my top 10 all time.	1
4272	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Fucking creepy ass movie.	0
4273	City of God	A great work, very dramatic, we can get a view of a completely different life, with it's own laws...spectacular work!	2
4274	Raging Bull	A classic with a showstopping performance by Robert De Niro in arguably his best role (though I prefer him in Taxi Driver). Brutal boxing scenes combined with an overall brutal person who is out to prove himself not just to others but to himself. In the end it's also about what drives men's insecurity and what causes them to hurt the ones they love.	2
4275	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	Peliculon!	1
4276	True Romance	86	1
4277	Badlands	Martin Sheen gives one of the great all-time film performances as the charmingly self-effacing sociopath Kit Carruthers. Narrated sleepily by the perfectly blank-faced Sissy Spacek, Badlands is a haunting, sprawling masterpiece that is determined not to judge its two lead characters and, with control astonishing for a first-time director, succeeds completely. Malick is already in almost total control of the hypnotic style that has become his trademark and makes him my favorite director.	2
4278	City of God	good true and honest story	2
4279	Donnie Darko	Beautiful. 	2
4280	Don't Breathe	This is a very suspenseful film with some good performances. Stephan Lang's character (The blind man) is portrayed well, as a desperate man who is psychologically damaged. The cinematography and sound design is very good, and some attempt is made to flesh out the main characters. The film relies more on psychological scares which set it apart from the usual Hollywood mix. 	0
4281	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Simply awesome concept... for that alone, I give it a score of 90.	2
4282	Inception	One word: Amazing!  The story is mind bending..you could need to watch it twice to fully understand it.! DiCaprio is as usual amazing, This is really Spielberg's masterpiece. The music is out of the world! You will keep listening to those soundtracks by Hans Zimmer over and over!  	2
4283	Ace Ventura: Pet Detective	really funny.	2
4284	Pan's Labyrinth	Truely a masterpiece in visualization. 	2
4285	Drive	Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is a highly effective tribute to the lone wolf crime dramas of the '70s and '80s. Refn deftly maneuvers between quiet, character-building scenes and intensely violent action throughout the film. Ryan Gosling shines as the stoic lead, and Albert Brooks gives a remarkable performance playing very much against type. The leisurely pace of the film's first half keeps it from being an instant classic, but Drive is still one of the most interesting films of the year.	2
4286	Shaun of the Dead	I can't think of a single reason not to give this 100.	1
4287	It	This movie made me afraid to go in the bathroom when I first saw when I was a kid.	1
4288	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	film hakkinda sifir bilgiyle, sifir beklentiyle gidip, sinemadan suratimda siritislarla cikmak. <3 aslinda cok zorlama olur diye dusunmustum ama bence olmamis, hatta o cok sevdigimiz karakterlerin yasliligini gormek beni garip bi sekilde etkiledi ve huzunlendirdi.	1
4289	Melancholia	Hm..I was expecting so much more..Maybe that was the problem.	0
4290	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	Dark, funny, and deep.  Leading acters are Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Kirsten Dunst. That tells you the amazing talent in this movie, and that's only a fraction of it.  If you like Tim Burton movies, you will love this!	2
4291	Rushmore	Engaging and amusing menage-a-trois involving a millionaire businessman, a school teacher and a schoolboy. That makes it sound a bit racey - but it isn't! It is, however, witty, quirky, and at its best, charming.	2
4292	Fargo	If you're in the mood for clever and ironic (if not emotionally engaging) then this is it.  The Cohen brothers reached their peak with this unsentimental film about human folly in the heartland.	2
4293	Echo In the Canyon	Not as good as I'd hoped. Needed a bit less of the covers by modern musicians and more stories from the key figures. Just too surface level. 	0
4294	Donnie Darko	A perfect movie for an angsty teenager.	2
4295	Drive	"It's difficult to explain exactly what this movie is. Over the top, exciting, anxiety-producing, Drive makes you want to root for the guy that makes-out with a pretty woman in an elevator before viciously stomping on the other occupant's head in the elevator (whom, admittedly, would probably have done the same...).

Drive is an adrenaline shot to the spot in your heart that produces yearning, sympathy and fear, all at once."	2
4296	Léon: The Professional	All the drama very thrilling yet sad all the way. 	2
4297	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	Good movie, great plot, very interesting story idea. Jim Carey is actually very good in this.	2
4298	Se7en	Suspenseful and engaging 	2
4299	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	the long awaited movie does not disappoint	2
4300	Akira	"Amazing animation and complex plot. Constant action and intrigue to keep the most cynical anime critics interested. If you're going to see any Japanese animation in your lifetime, see this one.				"	2
4301	Drive	Great character design, balanced and sensible gore, great climaxes all around the film. Exciting.	2
4302	Fight Club	You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.	0
4303	Primer	Quite confusing the first time around, but worth watching again, makes the movie much more rewarding	2
4304	Don't Breathe	This is a very suspenseful film with some good performances. Stephan Lang's character (The blind man) is portrayed well, as a desperate man who is psychologically damaged.

4305	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Simply awesome concept... for that alone, I give it a score of 90.	2
4306	The Cabin in the Woods	Top notch concept and execution and play on many subtexts	2
4307	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	500th. Chose you McDonagh.	1
4308	Digimon: The Movie	A decent film, though it's clearly suffered from its localization. It also loses points for the single most awful piece of product placement I've ever seen.	0
4309	Loving Vincent	Sad story, impressive paints.He was a very creative painter who looking the world from different perspective.  	2
4310	Aliens	best sequel ever, along with T2.	2
4311	The Notebook	ulitimate chick flick, yet will get the boyfriend into it to.  Love is aboud in this one.  Lots of love triangles and a sweet ending	2
4312	The Dark Knight	Best Batman ever. Someone finally grasped the mentality of the Joker. His crimes were more thought out, deadly, and more symbolic than in the past Batman movies. Only reason this movie gets one pt deducted is because of the change between leading actress. Im wasn't a big fan of whats her face.	0
4313	Never Let Me Go	What I'm not sure about is, if our lives have been so different from the lives of the people we save, we all complete. Maybe none of us really understand what we've lived through. (Never Let Me Go, film, 01:36:19) 	0
4314	Inception	Christopher Nolan directs a deep, mind-blowing scifi film. What impressed me the most with this film was how well-writen it is. The plot never seemed to drag, and the dialogue was very articulate. The special effects were dazzling, because Nolan filmed them by using more generic means, rather than use a ton of CGI. I loved this film, however my only gripe is that it was a bit long, but if you can ignore that. then give it a watch.	2
4315	Pan's Labyrinth	A beautiful movie.	2
4316	Commando	When I was a kid this was my favorite movie...by the way, did I mention I loved cheese when I was a kid?	2
4317	The Wolf of Wall Street	Way too long.But Di Caprio incredible..	2
4318	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas	Happily runs with it's own surreal ideas and the film benefits from it, much like Gilliam's Monty Python animations. 	2
4319	City of God	A movie about the brazilian underground life and a definite must see.	0
4320	The Dark Knight	Best Batman ever. Someone finally grasped the mentality of the Joker. His crimes were more thought out, deadly, and more symbolic than in the past Batman movies.

4332	Manchester by the Sea	Great acting, great characters. Definitely one of my favorite slice of life like movies.	2
4333	WALL·E	Unexpectedly emotional,beyond sweet and inspiring.One of the best animation of all time.	2
4334	The Silence of the Lambs	superb suspense, and excellent Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins	2
4335	The Lobster	The first part is hilarious, but by the time the main character gets out, the movie becomes weirder and lacks the frequent bits of humour that made the first part so amusing.	2
4336	Bart Got a Room	Pretty bland. Had a few funny moments, the ending was probably the highlight of the movie. 	0
4337	Raiders of the Lost Ark	On my top 10 all time.	1

4339	City of God	A great work, very dramatic, we can get a view of a completely different life, with it's own laws...spectacular work!	2
4340	Pennies from Heaven	A lovely modern fable that is a perfect companion film to Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark.  Steve Martin's take on the idealistic Arthur was criminally underpraised, as was the subtle but powerful Jessica Harper.  The musical numbers are lovely, and any film that provides a monumental dance number from Christopher Walken is a masterpiece especially when in this rich of a film.	2
4341	Inception	Its the only Movie that I have watched in my whole Life that after the last scene Everybody in the theatre just stood up and applauded the Genius of Nolan	2
4342	Sin City	Brilliant movie...like the comics	2
4343	The Notebook	Maybe I would have liked the movie better if I hadn't read the book.  The book is absolutely amazing and the movie doesn't compare.  Great story though.	2
4344	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Great start to an awesome trillogy	2
4345	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Interesting, original idea!	2
4346	Pride & Prejudice	Great adaptation with a beautiful score for a beautiful movie. The chemistry between the axtors portraying the bemmet family radiates through the screen and the entire film. A must see.	2
4347	Se7en	I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please !	2
4348	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	Of course very shocking for it's day, but remains relatively tame. Take away the subject matter this is a sub par film.	0
4349	Seven Samurai	Without doubt a very fine movie, but for me the experience wasn't quite as great as it was for most others, it seems. I found it extremely enjoyable, but not quite interesting enough to be a masterpiece	1
4350	City of God	A movie about the brazilian underground life and a definite must see.	0
4351	Donnie Darko	Nicely done dark movie.	2
4352	City of God	A great work, very dramatic, we can get a view of a completely different life, with it's own laws...spectacular work!	2

4385	Nurse Betty	This movie rocks totally hard.  Morgan Freeman is dignified as always, but he's also going to kill you at any moment.	0
4386	The Long Day Closes	Rather than dabble in a straightforward narrative that would be easier to follow but occlude the things that really mattered, Terrence Davies films this story of his childhood in Malickian slice-of-life form. Sounds (like the titular song) and images (an overhead shot blending play, school, and religion) merge to form an impressionistic portrait that focuses on feelings rather than ideas. The result is one of the most powerful, honest, and sincere statements ever made in cinema.	2
4387	Gattaca	Great flick.	2
4388	Wreck-It Ralph	The first film with video game humor that wasn't a groan fest. Wreck It Ralph pulls you in with its in jokes but where the movie shines is oddly enough its original content it puts a spin on from original characters to originalish video games. An excellent job by Disney.	2
4389	Jaws	My all-time favourite 'creature' movie until KingKong came along to dethrone it! No CGI special-effects... no trickery... just pure 'creature' terror with great performances! The shark steals the show, though!	2
4390	Avatar	At first it was a great experience, however upon reflecting on the movie, problems arise and you start to get pissed. How did Cameron take 10 years to make such predictable recycled plot? Everywhere there's a cliche. James Cameron is lucky because some actors did a great job (mostly Zoe Saldana). However, it is a mediocre movie and most of the hype comes from marketing (you can't fool me twice, Cameron). After you wipe all the glitter from your eyes  it boils to a cash machine.	0
4391	Tropic Thunder	I wanted to like this, but it's just not that funny. The jokes are too far between, and not really that funny either. The action part is completely moronic and takes too much of the time.	0
4392	Hero	Simply beautiful. The colors!	2
4393	Fight Club	Best movie made, awesome.	2
4394	Isle of Dogs	B-	1
4395	Pan's Labyrinth	One of the best movies i have seen. 	2
4396	Cop and a Half	I don't think it's that bad. Obviously they were using cheesy lines on purpose and if you can't see that then you're just retarded. The common humor throughout the movie was good. I more or less liked the fact that there wasn't any suspense. Suspense in any kind of movie is just annoying.	0
4397	The Princess Diaries	I absolutely LOVED this movie!!  Charming and funny!!  	2
4398	Alamar	Though the Banco Chinchorro is clearly beautiful to look at in the film, the relationship between Jorge and Natan is even more incredible. The depiction of their relationship while together before Natan returns to his mother in Italy reminds fathers and aspiring fathers what it means to have a loved one and why it's always important to cherish them. Nestór, as the father of Jorge and grandfather to Natan, bestows life lessons about the simplicity of life at sea and enjoying the life around us.  	2
4399	The Umbrellas of Cherbourg	Unique French musical with enchanting music by Michel Legrand and poetic lyrics and direction by Jacques Demy. One of the most romantic films ever made.	2
4400	L.A. Confidential	hell yeah. guy pearce and kevin spacey are phenomenal in a tightly written, excitingly paced A-plot. the subplot with russell crowe, initially irritating, turned out to play a vital and very noteworthy role in the film's second half. only wish the final shootout had gone a little differently, but still a very exciting, well crafted film.	2
4401	Audition	not as good as i was hoping.. still that bitch be crazy	0
4402	Deadpool	An good film made bad, by a low budget	2
4403	The Revenant	Some of the best camera work of any movie I've seen, especially during moments of action. Very fluid and immersive. Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.   Spectacular lighting. The story and characters lack complexity, but it excels in everything it tries to achieve. 	2
4404	Toy Story	Pixar's very first movie. Its animation completely changed how cartoon movies are made.	2
4405	Aliens	What makes this film so good is not just the great cast, sets and storyline, but also the spot-on pacing. For that reason it's best to avoid the directors cut and stick with the theatrical version.	2
4406	Murder on the Orient Express	If you watched Sherlock Holmes (2009), which is hard not to compare with, this one is less dramatic, less dark, less intense, less polished, and a bit less fluent. Do depending on your mood it can be better or worse. The strong point of the movie is that it's easy to watch, enjoyable, without being a stupid show movie. The weak point is that I won't watch it again or remember it much.	0
4407	The Incredibles	Great family fun	2
4408	Any Given Sunday	"When watching a film based on the events of a sport team, theres is always a feeling that despite how enjoyable the opening two thirds are, it will inevitably disappoint, as the ending can only follow two routes, they're gonna win or they're gonna lose.
  
  Of course this film cannot conjure up any additional options but it provides an ending that is both inspiring to fit the awesome Pacino monologue without feeling like a forced happy ending.
  
  Gripping from start to the twist of a finish."	2
4409	All the Real Girls	my favorite movie about relationships by one of my favorite directors.  	2
4410	The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics	Clever and solid, but the line could have done better than that shallow dot.	2
4411	Knives Out	After the disaster that was The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson is back to form with a very entertaining murder mystery. Nothing out of the ordinary, but very well made with good acting. There's some self-aware subversion of the genre, but it's never obnoxious. Only blemish are the gratuitous political jokes that will be outdated by the time the movie is available for streaming. 	0
4412			1
4413	12 Monkeys	Could be a great movie, but it has one huge flaw: Bruce willis is coherent and intelligent most of the time, but in situations where his credibility is important, he conveniently (for the plot) turns into a blabbering maniac. c'mon guys!	2
4414	Star Trek	An excellent restart to the Star Trek franchise. I never really watched the original series or movies, but I still really got into the movie. It was a perfect mix of trek-iness and regular action.	2
4415	Double Indemnity	Great story, script and direction. The performances are all special, but Edward G Robinson is amazing. 	2
4416	Taxi Driver	loved the raw epicness of this movie	2
4417	Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels	This movie is EPIC! The sub-plots collide at the perfect moment when nothing could get any worse for the main characters, or anyone else for that matter. It is a twisting tale of unknown betrayal and unkind life in the gangster world in London.	2
4418	Predator 2	HELL YEAH!!	0
4419	The Incredibles	Brad Bird's masterwork, now if they would only make a second one . . .	1
4420	Inception	Ótimo filme, bem complexo, com ótimas atuações e script muitíssimo interessante, na minha opinião melhor filme de 2010. 	1
4421	The Conversation	Incredible, incredible music, worthy of repetition. 	2
4422	The Silence of the Lambs	Scary, but good!	2
4423	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	A pretty good sci fi world, but with added Speilberg sentimentality.	2
4424	Birth	Almost as good as a real birth, 100 out of 10 stars.	2
4425	The Terminal	A wonderful story of a Man who is a foreigner in every way to the american soil but not a foreigner in the basic shrewdness of human mind. A Man who is very good at heart and intelligent comes out of a very dicey situation a winner who wins many friends even tho he has no adequate understanding of the language. The guy who is forced to live at the airport due to war in his homeland and coz the embassy cannot give him any visa to any foreignland due to the ongoing war in his homecountry.	1
4426	Beyond the Black Rainbow	Nice setting doesn't save this movie from being terrible. Lots of useless scenes make the film go on with almost no plot, and still, when something happens, it's impossible to understand it and follow what's going on.	2
4427	Faces Places	Banksy meets the French New Wave, with delightful results	2
4428	Jesus Christ Superstar	The music is so righteous it's hard not to like.	0
4429	Diary of the Dead	Boring film...worth the watch for the gore!	0
4430	Alien	I like Aliens better, but this is still great	2
4431	The Nightmare Before Christmas	great score, animation is original and dark.	2
4432	Boyhood	Kan Linklater skuffe? Samme hva slags filmer han lager ender det opp som noe eget og svært Linklater-ete, være det seg animasjonsfilmer satt inne i drømmene til en fyr eller en halvveis dokumentarisk gjenfortelling av en drapssak i en liten amerikansk småby. Coltrane er et funn, og det er et under at Linklater klarte å treffe så godt med en seksåring. De andre skuespillerne skinner også, men det mest imponerende er selve plottet, som snur opp ned på alt hva man tenker om dramaturgisk utvikling. 	1
4433	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Great plot, bit too sweet (Spilbergs work?) Entertaining and good philosophy and basic values presentation. And its not pathethic, silly or teaching. 	2
4434	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	overrated	1
4435	Wanted	Could very well be the most exciting action film you'll see all year. Wanted is a heavy metal thrill ride that is so ludicrously over the top in ever aspect which makes it even more entertaning.	2
4436	The Experiment	Great film about the addicting and intoxicating effects of power and the abuses that may result.  In addition to the film everyone should google the Stanford Prison Experiment and read the fascinating study.	2
4437	The Incredibles	It is rare to see a father figure portrayed in a positive light now days. This film does a great job of just being a good family oriented modern movie. Mom's just may have a problem with seeing little Jack Jack (their precious baby) go basaltic on the bad guy. 	2
4438	300	the trailer was the best :(...	2
4439	Predators	(spoil alert) Great popcorn movie: special effects, watch it with your friends. Very Predictable. The predator fight could have been much better. No new amazing weapons. It's Hollywood recycling at its best, ergo, not too good.	1
4440	Gravity	Spectacular and full of excitement. At the end you feel like how fragile is life in space and how it feels great to be on the earth! The irony in this film is that if it really happens in space you definitely will not survive but on the other hand, it's almost impossible that a catastrophe like this happens in earth's orbits. Must be watched in 3d.	2
4441	Heaven's Gate	If I could I would give 48516547325643873463	1
4442	Akira	One of the best anime's I've seen. Good plot that will require repeated viewing to fully digest.	2
4443	Akira	Very good.	2
4444	Twilight (A Quarantine)	Beautiful cinematography - the colours are so rich. They remind me of David Lynch's (think Blue Velvet, The Inland Empire). Or Lynch's colours remind of Duelle's. Anyway, a treat for the eyes! 	2
4445	Dawn of the Dead	"I guess zombie movies don't do it for me after all...
They are not interesting as vilans, everything is predictable, there is no real plot, and it's still full of holed, no character is explored enough for us to care about. oh, and not scary too."	0
4446	Mad Detective	Based around the simple concept of a bizarre, unconventional police detective with the mysterious abillity to see peoples hidden personas, Mad Detective is anything but formulaic and right from the start disuades any notion that this is just another flashy HK crime film. What follows is a highly ingenious, highly inventive and above all, highly entertaining piece of cinema. If you're after a crime film that's as inventive and intriguing as it is enjoyable, you can't go wrong with Mad Detective.	2
4447	Y Tu Mamá También	Sexy, funny, and sad. It reminded me so much of the time I've spent in Mexico, and it's one of my favorite films ever made.	2
4448	Mulholland Drive	Regardless of whether you understand it or not (it takes a little while but you'll get it), all the scenes, even standing by themselves, are stellar. The tension throughout the movie is done so masterfully that it makes me crawl inside my own skin, and Naomi Watts drops one of the most jaw-dropping performances I've ever seen. Great performances from everyone else as well. The dialogue is genius. Simply put, the best movie I've ever seen, and honestly the best I think I ever will see.	2
4449	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	A lovely adventure harking back to eighties pirate flicks for sunday afternoons.	2
4450	Foxy Brown	Fun but nowhere near the same league as Coffy. 	0
4451	Frankenstein	Bit of a mess - James Whale hadn't got a handle yet on how to balalnce the Ruritanian comedy vs. horror elements. But Karloff is amazing ( just his ARM is amazing in one scene), and Colin Clive's prissy performance is classic camp.	2
4452	Amadeus	The closest a film has ever gotten to perfection.The direction is just superb,the acting is excellent,the script, and how could I not mention the amazing set design.This film is almost perfect in every area.Highly recommended.	2
4453	Carnival of Souls	It's like a dream. Easy to see the influence on later directors	2
4454	The Descent	despite everyone's protestations to the contrary, not intelligent	1
4455	The Haunting of Hill House	Terrible writing, mediocre acting, definitely not scary. 	0
4456	The Notebook	Film to make someone wet.	0
4457	Martyrs	Impeccably made. Possibly the best 'horror' film of the modern era. At the same time Martyrs is the first movie I've seen which genuinely fits the moral panic moniker 'torture porn'. From the opening scenes of a small child's terror at an invisible threat, to the finales decent into incomprehensible violence and grotesquery, Martyrs is a dark feast of unforgettable images and nightmarish ideas. 	2
4458	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	I don't think this story was meant for movie-format, but I thought that the director did a good job. It isn't the same experience as the book, but I love the story in itself so much that it was difficult not to enjoy the movie.	1
4459	The Irishman	Lost interest somewhere half way through, never really got the feel of what the whole thing was about, and the time jumps didn't fit in. Great cast and photo but this CGI youth serum thingy was kind of ridiculous and poorly made, or the effect itself was nice but when De Niro moving around as the 80(?) year old he is it doesn't matter if his face looks like 30. Like when he was beating up that shop owner and kicking him to the curb, it looked like he was using a walking chair while doing it :D	0
4460	You've Got Mail	Classic romantic comedy and what the genre should always look like. Meg Ryan is a rom-com darling for a reason. 	2
4461	Forrest Gump	A film So sentimental and so innocent at heart that i immediately fell for it. I'm not an emotional person and I do not enjoy many emotional films. But this one, I loved!	2
4462	Zero Dark Thirty	this movie not true	1
4463	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug	Film was too long, especially with it's slow pacing. Combat was ok, but there was too much combat. No great soundtrack and Tauriel and Bolg didn't made any sence. Also, they tried to make the movie much more epic and funnier than it actually was. The last 40 minutes of the movie: noob.	0
4464	Gladiator	My name is gladiator	1
4465	Cloverfield	Not A Brilliant Plot, Not A Brilliant Acting, Just a Great Idea that worked well.The Concept is very cool and well done, some random cuts really makes it more realistic, altought, the Monster idea would work better if it was a little bit more discreet.	1
4466	Inception	Saugokit savo totemus!	1
4467	Three Colors: White	Tünelin sonunda az da olsa ışık varmış 	1
4468	City of God	classic	2
4469	The Matrix	Best of its era	2
4470	The Big Lebowski	The dude abides... by the fact that this movie is amazing. Hilarious and thought-provokingly surreal at the same time, this movie diserves its cult status, though nowadays its greatness is more universally accepted. The Coen brothers at their finest (are they ever not at their finest?)	2
4471	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	I watched it second time and I liked it. I guess it depends on the mood...	2
4472	Snatch	one of the best all-time	2
4473	Tropic Thunder	Hilarious movie if you are well aware of hollywood and film making, and of the movies being parodied, and especially if you know the actors. I imagine it might lose something if any of those conditions are not true for you.	2
4474	Over the Hedge	At least DreamWorks tried to make the characters look like their actors this time.  Still...no magic.	0
4475	Paul Blart: Mall Cop	If you view it as a spoof of Die Hard, its not god-awful. In fact, I kind of liked it, haha.	0
4476	Into the Wild	Both this kid and the film made about him are pretentious and self-absorbed.	0
4477	Mona Lisa	interesting, dark, innocet	2
4478	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Completes the story with awesome battle scenes and great acting.	2
4479	Jurassic Park	You have to admire it technically but there's not much else to admire.	1
4480	Toy Story	Pixar's very first movie. Its animation completely changed how cartoon movies are made.	2
4481	Aliens	What makes this film so good is not just the great cast, sets and storyline, but also the spot-on pacing. For that reason it's best to avoid the directors cut and stick with the theatrical version.	2
4482	Murder on the Orient Express	If you watched Sherlock Holmes (2009), which is hard not to compare with, this one is less dramatic, less dark, less intense, less polished, and a bit less fluent. Do depending on your mood it can be better or worse. The strong point of the movie is that it's easy to watch, enjoyable, without being a stupid show movie. The weak point is that I won't watch it again or remember it much.	0
4483	The Incredibles	Great family fun	2
4484	Any Given Sunday	"When watching a film based on the events of a sport team, theres is always a feeling that despite how enjoyable the opening two thirds are, it will inevitably disappoint, as the ending can only follow two routes, they're gonna win or they're gonna lose.
  
  Of course this film cannot conjure up any additional options but it provides an ending that is both inspiring to fit the awesome Pacino monologue without feeling like a forced happy ending.
  
  Gripping from start to the twist of a finish."	2
4485	All the Real Girls	my favorite movie about relationships by one of my favorite directors.  	2
4486	Shrek: The Musical	Absolute masterpiece. Some have called it the Citizen Kane of the 21st century. Now I see why.	1
4487	Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion	What Shunya ITO created with Sasori is definitively one of the best wip-flicks out there. Combining sleazy exploitation - including all needed elements from group showers to lesbian sex encounters to rape - and avantgarde-resque installments mostly using colour and theatre settings this is a bit more than the usual misogynic sleaze fest. Featuring the unique Meiko KAJI turning the damsel in distress-character into a dangerous damsel that kicks arse this is only topped by the second installment.	2
4488	American Psycho	Despite having a terrific premise - and a chillingly brilliant performance from Christian Bale - I felt the film essentially did nothing but establish a series of loose ends which it never tied up. As a character piece; and as an example of how queasy violence SHOULD be portrayed in film; this is a must-see. It's just a shame that the pay-out (or lack thereof) gave no hint of closure, which made the whole experience oddly unsatisfying when the credits rolled.	0
4489	Midnight in Paris	Love this movie.  Owen Wilson is great, the unfolding of the time changes is great, the interplay of historical figures is great, the scenery of Paris is great ( I accidentally stayed a few days near to one of the main locations).  Romantic, realistic view of love and hope and confusion  So Good. DramaFFlop rating:(see my profile for details)  Dialogue=5, Rudeness=5, Acting=4, Messages=3, Action=5, Funny=4, Filmography=5, Lovable Characters=4, Orchestration=4, Plot=5. WeightedScore =90	2
4490	V for Vendetta	My english is not too good to write the coment that i want to do - Quiero comentar esta pelicula pero es mucho pa escribirlo en ingles. Toda la idea, la historia de un presente alternativo en un solo pais y que sea liderado por una persona con toda la imagen parecida a los nazis es muy buena...Muy buena actuacion de la Portman y McTeigue la dirigio muy bien, un final excelente y lo mejor es que nunca se sabe bien quien es. Bajo esta mascara hay un ideal, y un ideal es a prueba de balas	0
4491	Enemy	it was good but i think i didn't get the main idea clearly :P	0
4492	Fight Club	Fun, funny, great characters, fantastic plot, all in all great.	2
4493	Kate & Leopold	Delightful. The characters are so perfectly defined. It's a shame Meg Ryan already had those un-enchating lips.	2
4494	Harold and Maude	love it!	2
4495	Fred Claus	nothing special.... however, very much positive film 	0
4496	The Martian	To me, it's the best movie of 2015. 	2
4497	Ice Age	I can never see a watermelon without quoting this movie. It contained some great metahistorical comments and the dialogues were witty, but the humour was mostly on the level of slapstick, which is a shame. Overall I liked it, but somehow it didn't always succeed in keeping me attentive. There's this little 'click' inside my head that's missing to make this a great movie.	1
4498	The Notebook	Not a fan of Ryan Goslings acting	0
4499	Lilo & Stitch	I love that they included Elvis Presley's songs, being a fan of his that made me really happy	2
4500	Glen or Glenda	Exquisitely bad.	0
4501	You've Got Mail	No fancy soundtracks and ROFL jokes but it's an highly enjoyable romantic comedy from 2 great performances. Makes you remember the intense and emotions of 90's.	2
4502	You Don't Mess with the Zohan	Not even close to par for a Sandler movie. Way too many jokes were repeated over and over and many relied on just being crude instead of also having wit behind them.  Crude is fine, but if that is all I wanted, I would have gone and seen a bad Mike Myers movie.	0
4503	Gladiator	I was forced to watch this several times my freshmen year of high school. It was good at first, but the violence got to me.	0
4504	Velvet Goldmine	Filled with glam-rock glitter and *coughboyskissingcough* flamboyance, this movie has a great soundtrack and a genuinely confusing plot.  I had to watch it over a few times to understand what was going on.  But I love it!	2
4505	Run All Night	The action was ok but the dialogue was not.	1
4506	Splash	The film holds a special place in my heart. Fun and funny.	2
4507	May	I LOVE this movie. I am not a big horror fan, but wow. is all i can say. Perfectionism isnt all its cracked up to be....to many perfect parts not enough perfect wholes....oh god that was classic :) 	2
4508	Barry Lyndon	Write a Mini-Reviewjavascript:submitRanking('4564','5','36020')	1
4509	Queen of Earth	If you want a movie about a woman slowly descending into madness, and you also like staying awake during movies, watch Blue Jasmine.  Moss is of course brilliant, but there's not enough here to keep it compelling for two hours.	0
4510	Fight Club	The last great film of the 20th century.	2
4511	Gerald's Game	Woman chained to a bed for the duration of the film after rapey husband dies or something. Basically the whole thing is her imagining her awful husband being awful to her and remembering her awful father abusing her as a child. The ending is hilariously stupid but at least it is hilarious at all after the dull bilge preceding it.	0
4512	Nightbreed	"Works well as a spectacle. Ridiculous and entertaining. Clive Barker's direction is rough and unfocused, obviously a first film. Despite that, the film is fun and runs with its concept. Barker's trademark monster design is full bore. Makeup effects can be tacky but still entertaining to observe. Performances range from awkward to hammy. Cronenberg is beyond fun to watch.
Cliffhanger ending and jilted assembly makes it imperfect, but the Director's Cut is a good time."	2
4513	No Country for Old Men	Brilliant writing, fantastic acting and excellent, as usual, directing by the Coen Brothers. One of the best films in the 2000's and one of my favorite films of all time. 	2
4514	Birdman	certainly deserve the Oscars and it must be watched.	1
4515	Dead End	A painful, contrived mess.  On every level!	0
4516	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	loved this movie. i like the adventure and that it is a trilogy.	2
4517	Lake Placid	NOT A HORROR MOVIE.  Take is as straight comedy and you will enjoy it.  David E. Kelley is one funny dude.	2
4518	L.A. Confidential	hell yeah. guy pearce and kevin spacey are phenomenal in a tightly written, excitingly paced A-plot. the subplot with russell crowe, initially irritating, turned out to play a vital and very noteworthy role in the film's second half. only wish the final shootout had gone a little differently, but still a very exciting, well crafted film.	2

4525	Deadpool	An good film made bad, by a low budget	2
4526	The Revenant	Some of the best camera work of any movie I've seen, especially during moments of action. Very fluid and immersive. Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.   Spectacular lighting. The story and characters lack complexity, but it excels in everything it tries to achieve. 	2
4527	Toy Story	Pixar's very first movie. Its animation completely changed how cartoon movies are made.	2
4528	Aliens	What makes this film so good is not just the great cast, sets and storyline, but also the spot-on pacing. For that reason it's best to avoid the directors cut and stick with the theatrical version.	2

4530	The Princess Diaries	Nice movie. Too bad the sequel stunk. Could have been a cute series of 3 or 4 movies. 	1
4531	Memento	So Unique!  It seems hard to follow and then it all pulls together in the end.  My Favorite Line EVER in a movie, I Can't remember to forget You.  --WOW!	2
4532	Project X	what am i doing with my life.	0
4533	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	A cult movie for its day. Not sure how it ages	1
4534	Constantine	While taking massive liberties with the source material, Constantine has a lot to offer. Keanu Reeves, despite his limited emotional range, has more than what it takes to convingly portray a desperate, haunted man, cyncial and twisted. The movie's visual are stunning and inventive, there is able support from Tilda Swinton and Djimmon Honsou and Francis Lawrence makes a good impression as a director to keep an eye out for.	2
4535	Fight Club	It's intelligent and visually stunning. A great performance from Norton and the best Pitt film. They both look amazing hot in this film.	2
4536	Shaun of the Dead	fabulously wonderful	2
4537	Shaun of the Dead	Breathes new life into the zombie genre. Scary and funny, a one of a kind movie.	2
4538	Midnight in Paris	A truly great film. At first when Owen's character started to meet the great artists of the past I thought 'Aw, shit - another Purple Rose.... But as he realizes that what is happening is real and he comes to terms with and accepts it, I was intrigued. And Allen throws another curve at us when, instead of choosing to live in the past, Owen's character realizes the present is where he belongs. He also comes to terms with the fact that his fiancée and current work an not what he needs. 	2
4539	Devils on the Doorstep	Devils on the doorstep manages impressingly well to balance between the comic and the grave. At the same time the story fails to give enough depth to many characters and situations, ultimately taking the edge of the film.	0
4540	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Still the best of the four.	2
4541	Se7en	A modern-day classic.	2
4542	Felix the Cat: The Movie	what the hell is even happening to my life	0
4543	Seven Samurai	I don't like naming a favorite film, but if anyone asks this is my pick. It makes people think I'm cultured and sophisticated. Suckers. But I do love it- 3 hours of awesome film with no excess. 	2
4544	Rashomon	Nothing to do with the original story Rashomon, but, forced ending aside, a very entertaining story.	2
4545	Boogie Nights	just another porno	0
4546	Dogma	My favorite religious satire with some great laughs from an all-star cast, one of my favorite performances by Matt Damon. Also, Jay and Silent Bob ('nuff said).	2
4547	Clash of the Titans	it was so horrible. I was forced to watch this in my Astronomy elective. I was cringing throughout the entire movie.	0
4548	Boogie Nights	BAD	0
4549	The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift	"A memory: I watched the film in PA., USA...:)

If the film wasn' t meaningful for me, my rating score would be 56 points same as probable score. You are right, criticker!!!:)"	0
4550	Let the Right One In	AMAZING vampire film! Such a great premise, and atmosphere. If you can deal with reading subtitles, go for it! You won't regret it!	2
4551	Lars and the Real Girl	A fascinating movie that effortlessly switches from funny to heart-breaking as it progresses and features yet another unbeatable performance form Ryan Gosling. Manages to cleverly avoid the terribly obvious gags that come with a film about a man's love affair with a sexdoll.	2
4552	The Godfather	the best movie of all time	2
4553	City of God	A great crime movie with spectacular writing and cinematography.	2
4554	There Will Be Blood	A 3 hour triumph of acting, visuals, and sound that could have been 1 1/2 shorter.	2
4555	The Nightmare Before Christmas	Not sure if the greatest christmas movie or the greatest halloween movie.	0
4556	Guardians of the Galaxy	Liked it better than other recent superhero movies. Funny!	2
4557	Ring	One of the scariest movies I have ever seen.  It completely eschews a lot of ghost story conventions, creating a malicious spirit that blindly punishes everyone she can reach.  It really was one of the first answers to why don't you just move out of the house?  On first view I thought the script needed tweeking, but I later realized how everything I disliked made sense on subsequent viewings and was necessary.	1
4558	Serenity	If you liked Firefly, you will love Serenity. If you loved Firefly, well, just don't have anything heavy around you can throw.	2
4559	Star Trek: The Motion Picture	Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a flick that most people, even Star Trek fans, don't like. I think it's actually one of the better films in the series, and the one that's most like the original show. Robert Wise's direction is somber and more philosophical than the TV series, but that's part of what gives it its scope end epic feel. There would be better, more popular films to come, but Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a solid entry in a somewhat shaky franchise. 	2
4560	Billy Madison	"adam sandler = shit
"	1
4561	Hellraiser	The ideas and the special effects really make this movie. If you're looking for great acting, though, you'll be disappointed. 	2
4562	Leaving Las Vegas	Grande interpretação. Grande história. Grande fim.	1
4563	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	"In Sci-Fi genre it has excelent FX and story, as a Drama it is a trully emotional story that will touch every heart...
 It isn't better 'in my opinion', just because it has some long and paused scenes..."	2
4564	Powers of Ten	they made parody of this, called The Powers of Ten Parody, funny...	0
4565	Justice League	gal gadot only nice part;)	1
4566	Hulk	So melodramatic. 	0
4567	Atomic Blonde	Cut all fancy fighting scenes and we have 60 minutes of movie less. It is good to know that Mrs Theron still... can, but this is really too much. Vote for McAvoy.	0
4568	The Bridge on the River Kwai	This is my favorite David Lean film. There are, of course, the adventure sequences, but the truly memorable parts of the film involve Guinness' internal and external conflicts, Sessue Hayakawa's struggles between his mind and his country, and the obliviousness of the special forces team.  I can hardly think of a more fitting (or timeless) conclusion to a movie. Nothing short of brilliant.	2
4569	Inception	so clever!!!!	2
4570	From Hell	A travesty of a graphic novel adaptation. Alan Moore is spinning in his grave and he isn't even dead yet. None of the brilliance of the graphic novel was translated to the film and it proved that Johnny Depp cannot save every crappy movie that he's in.	0
4571	The Fifth Element	love this movie - comedy, sci fi , crazy story line and the characters are great.  love odd movies	2
4572	Fight Club	some people say it's overrated but i think that fight club is fantastic. the directing is amazing, the acting, it's just an amazing movie	2
4573	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Complete waste of money.. Very difficult to live up to a classic like A nightmare on elm street. Neither the special effects neither the cast were able to revive the atmosphere of the original. 	0
4574	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Excelent, will watch again.	2
4575	Apocalypse Now Redux	Simply brilliant. Coppola creates an utterly convincing and chaotic war-zone with some amazing cinematography and incredibly detailed use of sound. Top class performances from Sheen, Duvall and Brando ensure that the brilliant dialogue is delivered with great effect.	2
4576	Donnie Darko	Definitely prefer the standard movie over the new directors cut. 	2
4577	Where the Wild Things Are	SO HARD to rate this movie. I am really conflicted. It's beautifully filmed and acted. The monsters were perfect. It was just missing something, but I don't know what. It was a bit dull at times and odd. Oh, and the music is wonderful, as well.	2
4578	Force Majeure	Sadece erkeklik-aile-ilişkiler üzerine bir film değil. Modernlik ve insan doğası üzerine etkileyici bir film. İnsanoğlu doğaya hükmedebileceğini sandı ancak atladığı kendi doğasıydı. -Her şey kontrol altında. (mı)?	1
4579	The Big Lebowski	Too slow, funny at times	0
4580	Forrest Gump	I hate this movie	0
4581	Warrior	By rights this should be a shitty movie considering how formulaic its description is, but it's so perfectly executed, with incredible acting, great direction, and possibly the best use of a band's music in film I've ever seen with The National.	2
4582	Cinderela Baiana	BIG. F*CKING. CLASSIC.	2
4583	Pan's Labyrinth	Incredible monsters from Guillermo Del Toro, impressive vision of the brain retreating into a fantasy world when the real one is too horrible to deal with.	2
4584	Adaptation.	double the cage, double the pleasure 	1
4585	Catwoman	Halle Berry is smoking in her BDSM spandex, but sadly the script and story are one of the worst I've witnessed. Only worth watching for eye candy.	0
4586	Synecdoche, New York	Charlie Kaufman you are my hero!	1
4587	The Tree of Life	A modern cinema. Breathtaking.	2
4588	Pan's Labyrinth	Ineffable, indelible, and profoundly literary; a Goyesque masterpiece. One of the best films I've ever seen, a rich text that merits considerable psychological, historical, artistic, and metaphysical reflection. I'm still trying to find expression to appreciate & interpret all I saw and heard. Just be aware that it's graphically violent, almost to the point of excess. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find myself accepting the profuse brutality as necessary for the story to assert its full power.	2
4589	Nurse Betty	This movie rocks totally hard.  Morgan Freeman is dignified as always, but he's also going to kill you at any moment.	0
4590	Back to the Future Part II	Maximum entertainment.	1
4591	Winter Passing	Zooey Deschanel's character was so thoroughly unlikeable and uninteresting that I couldn't watch this movie past the first 30 minutes or so. Simply dreadful.	0
4592	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	thought provoking	2
4593	The Angry Birds Movie	One of the few redeeming qualities of this film was the use of puns. Other than that, I'm assuming it's some sort of weird allegory for Syrian refugees?	1
4594	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Jack Sparrow is such an iconic character.	2
4595	Donnie Darko	In my top 10 favorites ever. 	2
4596	Cars 2	Animation is great as always, but plot seems to be much derived from focus groups and Mater's popularity.	2
4597	War of the Worlds	Special Effects save it from absolute failure	0
4598	Suicide Squad	Another DC blunder that tries to cover up the bad writing and even worse editing with pop songs every thirty seconds.	0
4599	Young Frankenstein	This is my favorite Mel Brooks movie.  Or maybe Blazing Saddles is.  It's definitely one or the other.	1
4600	The Nightmare Before Christmas	great score, animation is original and dark.	2
4601	Boyhood	Kan Linklater skuffe? Samme hva slags filmer han lager ender det opp som noe eget og svært Linklater-ete, være det seg animasjonsfilmer satt inne i drømmene til en fyr eller en halvveis dokumentarisk gjenfortelling av en drapssak i en liten amerikansk småby. Coltrane er et funn, og det er et under at Linklater klarte å treffe så godt med en seksåring. De andre skuespillerne skinner også, men det mest imponerende er selve plottet, som snur opp ned på alt hva man tenker om dramaturgisk utvikling. 	1
4602	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Great plot, bit too sweet (Spilbergs work?) Entertaining and good philosophy and basic values presentation. And its not pathethic, silly or teaching. 	2
4603	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	overrated	1
4604	Wanted	Could very well be the most exciting action film you'll see all year. Wanted is a heavy metal thrill ride that is so ludicrously over the top in ever aspect which makes it even more entertaning.	2
4605	The Experiment	Great film about the addicting and intoxicating effects of power and the abuses that may result.  In addition to the film everyone should google the Stanford Prison Experiment and read the fascinating study.	2
4606	The Incredibles	It is rare to see a father figure portrayed in a positive light now days. This film does a great job of just being a good family oriented modern movie. Mom's just may have a problem with seeing little Jack Jack (their precious baby) go basaltic on the bad guy. 	2
4607	300	the trailer was the best :(...	2
4608	Predators	(spoil alert) Great popcorn movie: special effects, watch it with your friends. Very Predictable. The predator fight could have been much better. No new amazing weapons. It's Hollywood recycling at its best, ergo, not too good.	1
4609	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies	Like butter spread over too much bread...	0
4610	Zootopia	"Perfection!
"	2
4611	Inception	Honestly i don't know what i can say to praise this film that every other film critic hasn't. A masterful work by the director Christopher Nolan, this is hailed by many as his best film to date (so close Interstellar, yet so far). This movie plays out like one giant thriller puzzle, and we humans love solving puzzles. Or, at least, trying then getting it explained to. The cast is excellent, helmed by the talented DiCaprio. Epic set pieces and a moving plot make this movie a win in my book.	2
4612	Pulse	the cities are theirs but the will to live still survives...the ultimate ending.pame re veronica mars!!the best bad movie ever	0
4613	Catwoman	This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The only good quality was the fact that Halle Berry was the lead actress.	0
4614	Finding Neverland	Surprisingly good.	2
4615	Blow-Up	one of the best movies ever made without a doubt, antonioni perfectly matches a co-relation between reality and ilussion and the result is of course breathtaking and possisional between many similitudes as real life situations could get, how a photoghraper manages to see life between his art and how he manages to comprehend it is stunning; visually beautiful and in terms of meaningful state you get comprehend the concept of loneliness and how much fissures can cause in your daily life.	2
4616	Bamboozled	this is a difficult film 	0
4617	Hitch	This movie wasn't funny, but it did manage to put me to sleep.	0
4618	In the Cut	the visual sense, here seems revolutionary. recommending this, as i do all of janes films.	2
4619	BlacKkKlansman	The usual race-baiting trash from Spike Lee.	1
4620	Dirty Dancing	Pretty much the worst movie I've ever seen.	0
4621	The Nightmare Before Christmas	I love this film. The music is catchy and will easily get stuck in your head; and the plot is amazing. It's a twisted sort of love story which also revolves around the kidnapping of Santa, known as Sandy Claws Highly recommended film.	2
4622	The Ring Two	Definitely not as good as the first. The plot isn't as interesting, or good, and it's not as scary.  	0
4623	The Dreamers	What the hell was that? Ugh!	0
4624	Juno	Honestly this is my all-time-favorite movie. Between the simplistic realism in the awkward interactions that many teens can relate to and the actor choice this is always the first movie I show my friends.	2
4625	The Grand Budapest Hotel	The Grand Budapest Hotel totally exceeded my expectations! The design aesthetic was awe-inspiring, with pretty pink pastels and meticulous dollhouse like proportions. The stop-motion animation teamed with the laugh out loud Ralph Fiennes, brings to fruition a colour co-ordinated picture book full of nostalgia. This movie is a creatives person dream, imagination come to life, both stylistically and performance wise!	2
4626	Fight Club	Amazing performance of Edward Norton, psychoanalytical 	2
4627	Gladiator	I soo fucking love this movie. The characters are awesome, the plot crush like a tornado of emotions and the action scenes are great. Finally, the phrase win the crowd and you'll win your freedom is amazing. By all means, Watch this movie!	2
4628	Triple 9	Reminded me of Pusher. Great action, raw, mysterious. Very physical. 	2
4629	The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel	Like a unique cross between Lost in Translation, Little Miss Sunshine, and Slumdog Millionaire. Though the movie is far from perfect, the characters are each fascinating to watch and the themes and emotions the movie evokes really touched a nerve in me. It hits on human-existentialism, finding meaning in life, love, changing ourselves and our environment, accepting others who are different than us, growing old, and losing people we care about. It also has a lot of funny moments. 	2
4630	Predator 2	HELL YEAH!!	0
4631	The Incredibles	Brad Bird's masterwork, now if they would only make a second one . . .	1
4632	Red	John Malkovich steals the film	1
4633	Tôkyô zankoku keisatsu	Disgusting, depraved and endlessly inventive. :D	2
4634	House of 1000 Corpses	It's like Zombie wasn't sure he'd get to make another film, so he tried to cram every idea he'd thought of over the years into this one, with mixed results. The movie is, not coincidentally I'm sure, a lot like one of those spooky carnival rides that it begins with. We go from set-piece to set-piece quickly without much fuss connecting them, each happening being some mix of creepy and campy that might make you wince and/or laugh. Loses its way at the end. Overall it's fun, Sid Haig is amazing.	2
4635	The Mummy	awesome	2
4636	Toy Story	love it when i was a kid.	2
4637	Tower	Beautiful, vivid and unique.  Tower is a depiction of true crime history that carries itself less like a documentary than a moving painting- a human mosaic told from multiple angles.  Fear, humility, heroism, nostalgia, love, grief and gratitude splash onto the screen, untainted by the main antagonist, who is never shown.  This choice highlights the true experience of the day and its aftermath for the people of Austin.	2
4638	Gladiator	Great film, Russell Crowe provides a great performance, telling the story of a man framed and betrayed. My favorite film in this genre.	2
4639	The Big Lebowski	The perfect comedy!	2
4640	Marriage Story	Pros: All the acting (especially Driver); direction; tone  Cons: N/A	1
4641	Drive	While it embraced a lot of modern themes that will draw in the casual crowd, there are notes of existentialism and character study in this to make it deeper than most. Very well acted.	2
4642	The Talented Mr. Ripley	Paid for the whole seat, but I only needed the edge. Yeah...	0
4643	Hero	"(pt-br)
http://filmedodia.net/fdd298-hero2002-heroi"	1
4644	Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen	I couldn't even sit through the entire thing.	1
4645	Krakatoa, East of Java	Krakatoa is west of Java.	1
4646	The Sixth Sense	Excellent concept. The final plot twist was kept well wrapped even though it was in the open. One of the best movies of Shyamalan. Most of his other movies lack something that this had. He has picked nice concepts in all his movies, but this is the one which turned out well.	0
4647	Les Fiancés du pont Mac Donald ou (Méfiez-vous des lunettes noires)	Amusing short that was able to gather a handful of future film icons on one film. Not sure what else I can say about it, writing this text already took me longer than watching the short itself. I liked it.	0
4648	Cobra	the most perfect example of the shit-stupid 80s action wankfest. and its an absolute pleasure to watch every single time.	2
4649	Friday	Yes. That is 100. Craigs father is one of the top 3 supporting role characters of all time. from hilarious to heartfelt. when craig pulls a gun aimin to defeat Deebo its his dad that gives says THE line of the film. if you fight with ur fist u might lose, but u live to fight another day. Friday. 100. A .	2
4650	Marketa Lazarová	"Try to imagine medieval men and women as they were, and not as people of the XXIth centurey dressed in medieval clothes. Try to understand how they though, how they loved, how they believe in God (or gods), how they had fear and honor and greed.
 Add the image genius of a Kurosawa or a Leone, the mysticism of a Bergman, a lanscinant music, the beauty of Czech plains...
 This is Marketa Lazarova, one of the best movie ever made."	2
4651	Igby Goes Down	Jeff Goldblum with his pants down SHOULD be an automatic 100...	0
4652	From Hell	A travesty of a graphic novel adaptation. Alan Moore is spinning in his grave and he isn't even dead yet. None of the brilliance of the graphic novel was translated to the film and it proved that Johnny Depp cannot save every crappy movie that he's in.	0
4653	The Fifth Element	love this movie - comedy, sci fi , crazy story line and the characters are great.  love odd movies	2
4654	Fight Club	some people say it's overrated but i think that fight club is fantastic. the directing is amazing, the acting, it's just an amazing movie	2
4655	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Complete waste of money.. Very difficult to live up to a classic like A nightmare on elm street. Neither the special effects neither the cast were able to revive the atmosphere of the original. 	0
4656	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Excelent, will watch again.	2
4657	Apocalypse Now Redux	Simply brilliant. Coppola creates an utterly convincing and chaotic war-zone with some amazing cinematography and incredibly detailed use of sound. Top class performances from Sheen, Duvall and Brando ensure that the brilliant dialogue is delivered with great effect.	2
4658	Donnie Darko	Definitely prefer the standard movie over the new directors cut. 	2
4659	Where the Wild Things Are	SO HARD to rate this movie. I am really conflicted. It's beautifully filmed and acted. The monsters were perfect. It was just missing something, but I don't know what. It was a bit dull at times and odd. Oh, and the music is wonderful, as well.	2
4660	I Know Who Killed Me	5 points for a bionic leg that must be charged like a cell phone. You'd think it would have a better battery.	1
4661	Akira	The movie to create anime as a stand alone genre in the world of cinema. Its faced pased action and amazing detail make it a movie not to be missed. to compare it against anime of today i still think its detail and effects are amongst the best i have seen. Katsuhiro Otomo did an excellent job fitting such a large amount of story from the graphic novels into such a short movie. 	2
4662	The Big Lebowski	1st 	1
4663	Bubba Ho-Tep	pretty funny	2
4664	Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle	Comedy classic / Stoner comedy classic.  So many memorable scenes!	2
4665	Foxy Brown	Fun but nowhere near the same league as Coffy. 	0
4666	Frankenstein	Bit of a mess - James Whale hadn't got a handle yet on how to balalnce the Ruritanian comedy vs. horror elements. But Karloff is amazing ( just his ARM is amazing in one scene), and Colin Clive's prissy performance is classic camp.	2
4667	Amadeus	The closest a film has ever gotten to perfection.The direction is just superb,the acting is excellent,the script, and how could I not mention the amazing set design.This film is almost perfect in every area.Highly recommended.	2
4668	Carnival of Souls	It's like a dream. Easy to see the influence on later directors	2
4669	The Descent	despite everyone's protestations to the contrary, not intelligent	1
4670	The Book of Eli	A waste of amazing atmosphere, setting and alright acting for the purpose of furthering Christianity rather than telling an equally well-constructed story.	0
4671	Vicky Cristina Barcelona	Characters very two-dimensional, never became real to me. A moderately entertaining evening; at least the film cost me less than the beer I had with it.	0
4672	Serenity	Cannot find a better movie	0
4673	Pan's Labyrinth	Guillermo del Toro has become my favorite director with this movie. I admire such a lovely fantasy combined with the evil truths.	2
4674	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	My favorite movie... no questions asked.	2
4675	Almost Famous	Fantastic movie, one that I could watch over and over again and fall in love with every time. Great characters delivered with believable performances, especially by Kate Hudson. Cameron Crowe writes and directs a perfect story of sex, drugs, rock n' roll, and life on the road. The scene where the characters sing along to Elton John's Tiny Dancer is particularly enjoyable. 	2
4676	The Great Beauty	Felt longer than Italian spaghetti. Maybe if Martini didn't put so many ads in the movie, it wouldn't be so long and boring...	0
4677	Lars and the Real Girl	It works when it really shouldn't. The movie strikes an incredibly delicate balance that it maintains throughout, with much credit being given to Ryan Gosling in the lead. A very small number scenes did have me rolling my eyes at how saccharine or outlandish they were, but in the end, a very satisfying experience.	2
4678	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	It stands outside everything. It is both a masterpiece and disgusting.	2
4679	One Day	It's sort of your typical love story about best friends falling in love with each other. Beautiful and simple. Got me teary-eyed at the ending. Dex's love for Em was overflowing that I felt it. Brilliant flow of story, lovable characters, two thumbs up and hands down! =))	2
4680	The Irishman	Lost interest somewhere half way through, never really got the feel of what the whole thing was about, and the time jumps didn't fit in. Great cast and photo but this CGI youth serum thingy was kind of ridiculous and poorly made, or the effect itself was nice but when De Niro moving around as the 80(?) year old he is it doesn't matter if his face looks like 30. Like when he was beating up that shop owner and kicking him to the curb, it looked like he was using a walking chair while doing it :D	0
4681	Glass	woeful ending to the series.	1
4682	The Court Jester	You'll never out-fox the fox!	1
4683	Grosse Pointe Blank	Better than The Godfather (and pt. II), that for some insane reason was recommended to me. The main character faces difficult decisions on how he can keep separate his personal life and professional life	1
4684	Maborosi	a beautiful experience and exactly what i'm looking for in film right now, the kind of movie that lets you inhabit a world through slow pacing and beautiful shots framed meticulously. The themes are simple but are given space to unfold naturally with minimal exposition. the score is sparse so you pay attention when it floats in. the scene by the fire near the ocean was deeply poingnant and touched on a human quality of being drawn towards oblivion which i haven't seen observed like this before. 	2
4685	Memento	Interesting idea, but bland cinematography that didn't pull me into the story or make me care about the simple characters. I could see the ending coming halfway in, and that wouldn't have bothered me, but then Leonard's final monologue basically destroys the tragedy of his character and half of the broader points. A psychological thriller that is completely boring and unaffecting.	0
4686	Annie Hall	Yeek.  The whining and mysogyny is entirely unbecoming.  The movie is really about nothing except setting up Woody's rants, which occasionally garner an ironic guffaw or chuckle, but far more often an eye roll.  I guess the only positive of this movie is it's made me more attune to the times that I'm whiny and my sarcasm comes off like this, so hopefully I can be less like him.	0
4687	Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation	Brings me back...	2
4688	Trouble in Paradise	One of Lubitsch's true masterpieces. Like most comedies, this one really must be seen in a theatre with an appreciative, responsive audience on hand, but do watch it at home if that's your only option.	2
4689	The Book of Eli	A waste of amazing atmosphere, setting and alright acting for the purpose of furthering Christianity rather than telling an equally well-constructed story.	0
4690	The Silence of the Lambs	Good classic movie. A little too slow for my taste, yet it is pretty enjoyable.	2
4691	Ender's Game	Was a bit rushed. I thought the characters should have been more developed, and they glossed over some important relationships and time periods, but they didn't stray far from the book and it was visually  impressive. Great story, although paraphrased. Overall a satisfying adaption.	2
4692	Twister	Another guilty pleasure.	2
4693	Snatch	A rewatchable film with quick pace and well intertwined storylines, dry,  black humour and enjoyable action scenes.	2
4694	The Irishman	Scorsese proves again that he's still capable of repeating himself. I'm getting a little tired of it, though...	1
4695	The Artist	Some movies have a nice, meaningful story to tell. Some movies are beautifully made, and deliver a wonderful sensory experience. And some movies appeal to your feelings in a way that leaves you in a good mood after they've finished. This has the three, it's in black and white, and all the dialog could be written on a couple sheets of paper. What can I say, this was pretty impressive.	0
4696	Mr. Holland's Opus	Beautiful story of an ordinary life.	2
4697	Jurassic Park III	The plot-device to get Grant and company to the island is threadbare and hokey. Casting Michael Jeter as a mercenary with heavy weaponry is farcical. And, someone, please tell me how Téa Leoni gets cast in anything. Director Joe Johnston is simply not Steven Spielberg, who only served as Executive Producer on this outing. In its favor, the running time is mercifully short.	0
4698	Velvet Buzzsaw	Trying very hard but does not get anywhere for its effort, even with a great cast.	0
4699	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Great fun and still the best of the trilogy - rollicking pirate fun!	2
4700	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	The cinematography and action was amazing, as was the storytelling and dialogue. Although they're cliche now, the soundtrack and effects work well.	2
4701	The Fifth Element	A good-hearted, haute couture trashterpiece: could we ever have anything better of its kind?	2
4702	Alvin and the Chipmunks	I just don't give zero because the squirrels are cute, ok? 	1
4703	The Sting	ah!  the best.  great adventure, wonderful people	2
4704	Deadpool	Utterly hilarious!	2
4705	Waking Ned Devine	Octagenarian Irishmen defrauding the lotto commission - priceless.	2
4706	Gladiator	great movie, great musics...	2
4707	Tank Girl	i think that the soundtrack was actually an original recording of Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett crying and punching walls.	1
4708	The Big Lebowski	The Dude. 'Nuff said.	1
4709	Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog	great musical!	2
4710	City of God	Wonderful film! Wish I could see it again, I never find it.	2
4711	Goodfellas	Goodfellas is a amazing and masterful gangster film that is one of my favorite films ever made. #6 Favorite Film Ever  	2
4712	Her	"Loved it up until the very middle, where it peaked for me. Then it just trailed off, unfortunately. Story-wise, at least.

I have to add, however, that I feel like the next time I watch it I will like it better."	0
4713	Adaptation.	 I put off watching this forever because: Meryl Streep bugs me, no one could tell me what the film was about exactly, and fat Nic Cage. Well, I was dumb because Streep and Cage were amazing, and its impossible to explain what it's about! This movie is sublime and deeply affecting, the rare kind of film that gives you that tugging feeling in the pit of your stomach.	2
4714	Monsters, Inc.	I saw this movie when I was a kid and I was like THIS IS GAY KID SHIT but I watched it again a couple months back and hey it's p. good.	2
4715	Pan's Labyrinth	The most heartbreakingly beautiful film ever made. The visuals alone are enough to shake you to your core, but del Toro isn't content with shocking you. He takes you to a wold beyond our own and mesmerizes you with a stunning narrative and human characters. 	2
4716	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Not as good as the book, but Crazy Jack in one of his best roles. Is the character crazy or the actor. Probably both.	0
4717	Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid	the whole story based on a giant anaconda is a bit stupid 	0
4718	Inception	Convoluted and meaningless.	0
4719	Gozu	Takashi Miike's bizarre, frightening, and sometimes humorous tribute to David Lynch. The story of a man coming to terms with his own sexuality, masked as a supernatural thriller/mystery, bending genres in a way only Miike can do. Definitely one of my favorite films from the prolific director. 	2
4720	Fight Club	Almost gave this a much lower score. I don't dislike this movie, but I've always disagreed with (and been a little annoyed by) the kind of awed praise it manages to get from some people. It manages to pull off a trick that can never be pulled again, and it's impressive for that. It's very stylish, like you'd expect from Fincher. But it also revolves around trite commentary on modern 20-something masculinity, which means it loses some charm if you aren't testosterone-flush and 16 years old.	0
4721	Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	Best in the series 	2
4722	Slumdog Millionaire	Heavy-handed, melo-dramatic, manipulative and disrespectful to its audience. Disgustingly in-earnest post-ending dance scene, so much so that I was originally almost certain that it was meant in a parody sense, and was'nt to be taken seriously. All in all, utter shit and one the most embarrassing Best Picture desicions to date.	2
4723	Hard Rain	Generic action flick. The problem was that people change sides so often you're not actually sure who you should be rooting for and you end up getting confused and frustrated	0
4724	King Arthur	There are historic mistakes every minute. The only highlight is Keira Nightley, dressed with nothing but a leather strap, fighting an army of bastards in the cold, snowy scottish winter on a froozen lake.	1
4725	The Prestige	La guerre entre Hugh Jackman et Christian Bale est intense. Et la fin magnifique.	2
4726	Pacific Rim	its awsome	1
4727	Memento	weird	0
4728	Ma Mère	Just awful, despite the presence of Huppert.	0
4729	A Tale of Two Sisters	Amazing, beautiful and complex.	2
4730	Ice Cream Man	campy, the good kind of campy	1
4731	American Beauty	My Favorite	2
4732	The Celestine Prophecy	The acting and dialogue was so bad I expected a porn scene to happen at any minute.	0
4733	Wild Tales	"because this consists of action and reaction, i consider as a very deterministic movie which includes great anger stories
while i was watching, i was aware of similarities between turkish and argentinean culture. i liked the shooting technique.

i appreciated due to delighted 2 hours"	2
4734	V for Vendetta	My english is not too good to write the coment that i want to do - Quiero comentar esta pelicula pero es mucho pa escribirlo en ingles. Toda la idea, la historia de un presente alternativo en un solo pais y que sea liderado por una persona con toda la imagen parecida a los nazis es muy buena...Muy buena actuacion de la Portman y McTeigue la dirigio muy bien, un final excelente y lo mejor es que nunca se sabe bien quien es. Bajo esta mascara hay un ideal, y un ideal es a prueba de balas	0
4735	Enemy	it was good but i think i didn't get the main idea clearly :P	0
4736	Fight Club	Fun, funny, great characters, fantastic plot, all in all great.	2
4737	Kate & Leopold	Delightful. The characters are so perfectly defined. It's a shame Meg Ryan already had those un-enchating lips.	2
4738	Harold and Maude	love it!	2
4739	Fred Claus	nothing special.... however, very much positive film 	0
4740	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	Fantastic futuristic sci-fi movie of its time	2
4741	Drive	Ryan Gosling skillfully portrays two sides of a coin at once - one of a caring, family man, and one of a cold-blooded, vengeful murderer. Good story, great soundtrack, but for the regular moviegoer, the pacing of the movie may feel slow. A great watch nonetheless	2
4742	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Truly epic	2
4743	Red Lights	Movie went downhill fast after Sigourney Weaver character died and crash landed completely during the finale.	1
4744	The Matrix	cool sfx, but over-rated by fan boys into quasi-deep, pseudo-religious mental self-gratification. it was all a video game!!!	2
4745	City of God	Wonderful film! Wish I could see it again, I never find it.	2
4746	Goodfellas	Goodfellas is a amazing and masterful gangster film that is one of my favorite films ever made. #6 Favorite Film Ever  	2
4747	Her	"Loved it up until the very middle, where it peaked for me. Then it just trailed off, unfortunately. Story-wise, at least.

4750	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Perfect.	2
4751	Death Proof	Overly long, boring, and self indulgent	0
4752	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Probably my most favorite film of all time. Perfection. 	2
4753	Shaun of the Dead	Really good zombie movie, different than others in many ways. Be prepared to be surprised, this zombies are not the ones you know	2
4754	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Stupid movie for stupid people	0
4755	Napoleon Dynamite	Most overrrated movie EVER. The plot doesn't even seem to exist. Other than a few laughable lines or moments it's boring as they come. The climax comes and goes without you even knowing and then you get to the end and say, That's considered a movie? Don't buy the hype and waste your time.	0
4756	Hero	A masterpiece. Brilliant and beautiful. Visually stunning. Emotionally powerful. Action packed. Excellently choreographed. An epic retelling of a legendary piece of Chinese culture and history.	2
4757	The Revenant	my rating goes to bear attackt scene 	1
4758	Before Sunset	The rare sequel that actually improves upon the original. With a greater sense of urgency and a perfect ending, this one manages to build upon its predecessor and not only being better for it itself, but also enriching the first installment. One of the finest and smartest romance films of modern times.	2
4759	Trainspotting	Ew, gross.	0
4760	Never Let Me Go	Beautiful acting, beautifully filmed, beautiful story.	2
4761	Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle	It's cheesy and impossible not to laugh at, but still a fun ride from beginning to end. Cameron Diaz is bubbly, Crispin Glover is creepy, Lucy Liu is sexy and Drew Barrymore is...well...Drew Barrymore: the chick you wanna get high with while dropping water balloons over a freeway overpass. The anonymous Charlie assigns the angels to guard a software bigwig, while uncovering a plot to kill their boss. If you take the movie seriously AT ALL, then you wont enjoy it (and you might need some help)	2
4762	Mission: Impossible 2	Only because I was drunk	1
4763	Pitch Black	Low budget action Sci-fi done right. 	0
4764	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood	Worst Tarantino so far, can't really recall how terrible Kill Bill was, and I'm not about to rewatch it/them.	0
4765	The Night of the Hunter	The word 'idiotic' summarizes it perfectly.	0
4766	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	This, 3rd of the series, is beyond the word awesome or spectacular. I didn't even feel the 3hrs go by. This movie allows you to bend time and space thereby warping you to its end in what you feel as mere seconds.	2
4767	I Heart Huckabees	Superb.  One of the most original movies I've seen in a long time.  Great script.  Solid acting.  Even a moral or two.  It's a shame that this flick didn't get better press.  I suppose one more sign of my general deviance.	1
4768	Beauty and the Beast	Probably sentimental bias as it is the earliest movie can remember going to the theater to see. I still consider it the best animated movie.	2
4769	Troy	I love well done mythological fantasy films.  This didn't quite get to the well done part.	2
4770	The Man With a Movie Camera	"Given a time when movie is made it is a genuine avantgarde.It is  
unique perspective of urban life in Soviet Union of the time,but 
with the quality and ingenuity of directing it becomes a kaleidoscope of human manifesting life,an insight in what we are.Chelovek s kino-apparatom is another example of the beauty of film as an art form."	2
4771	Shaun of the Dead	We're comig to get you, Barbara!	2
4772	Cinema Paradiso	brilliant piece of art 	2
4773	Audition	A film about fears that appear to be reality	1
4774	The Godfather	OVERRATED	1
4775	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	There's some nifty shots in the first act, but once it goes into ARGHHH! I'M WET! for the last haf. Welcome to dullsville. 	2
4776	Dondurmam gaymak	Story of film is very similar to Ladri di Biciclette...	1
4777	Reign of Fire	one of my favorites.  i have seen better movies, but none that i find quite so delightful.	2
4778	Winter's Bone	Oh my god. Mind-blowingly slow, uneventful, and simply boring. I could not make myself care about this movie even as Ree got the shit kicked out of her.	0
4779	Se7en	One of the most amazing thriller/mystery films ever made. Each time I watch it I feel as if I'm watching it for the first time, feeling the same suspense again and again. I think it's one of the most innovative films in general, not just in the thriller section. It's plot is beyond perfection, all the actors give one of their best performances - with Kevin Spacey being my favorite one - and the soundtrack adds up to everything. One of Fincher's diamonds. Love it!	2

4782	The Sound of Music	lembro que vi de manhã no dia de Natal comendo camarão com molho vermelho que a minha mãe inventou e que sobrou da ceia!!!!	0
4783	The Martian	"Not really true to the source material. They left out a lot of the science that helped to explain how/why he did what he did. Also A LOT of the steps he went through. Like his rover customizations, wtf. And the ending- completely implausible. The book even explains why and uses another method.

They also left out my favorite joke- the Aquaman joke, for anyone that read the book.

Still, I love Matt Damon, and overall the movie was really good- even the slow bits."	1
4784	L'Auberge Espagnole	Such a great movie. 	2
4785	Hotel Chevalier	Decent style, not much substance... good for backstory to Darjeeling Limited, not much more.	0
4786	The Day After Tomorrow	Look at the pretty effects we can make!	1
4787	The Bourne Identity	The best Bourne movie ...	2
4788	Get Out	I'll cop to not being interested in the genre of horror as a whole, so it's notable that I would say this about this movie.  Get Out is *good* - it is not great. Maybe that's because of the limitations of the genre, which is does not transcend, but does not feel confined to.  Definitely see it, but don't expect to be amazed by anything save the fact that it's a straight horror movie that doesn't suck.	0
4789	Kiki's Delivery Service	the one Miyazaki film I didn't get.	1
4790	Three Colors: Blue	feeling so lonely after watch this movie	2
4791	Animal House	this movie is not funny and if you think it is then you need a kick in the vulva.	0
4792	Doctor Strange	Bruh. This is legit my favourite movie EVER. I'm not even kidding when I say that I've seen it 6 times... I absolutely adore all Marvel movies, but this BY FAR tops them all.	1
4793	True Romance	I would say utterly jubilant	1
4794	Goodfellas	Hard-hitting and stylish, Goodfellas is a gangster classic - and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career.	2
4795	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	I remember watching this when I was younger. I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I'd like to revisit and watch this again soon.	2
4796	Summer Wars	A gem. You should have a smile on your face the entire time.  Hosoda's second film lives up to the first.	2
4797	Shaun of the Dead	A downright fun take on zombie movies. Enjoyable the whole way through with a hilarious cast. I've never cheered so much at the death of one character in a movie before.	2
4798	Let the Right One In	AMAZING vampire film! Such a great premise, and atmosphere. If you can deal with reading subtitles, go for it! You won't regret it!	2
4799	Lars and the Real Girl	A fascinating movie that effortlessly switches from funny to heart-breaking as it progresses and features yet another unbeatable performance form Ryan Gosling. Manages to cleverly avoid the terribly obvious gags that come with a film about a man's love affair with a sexdoll.	2
4800	The Spirit Molecule	Filled with misinformation and drooling hippies rambling about nonsense.  Worthless.	0
4801	Little Otik	Three words: Cannibalistic log baby. Hard to go wrong with that.	0
4802	Her	95	1
4803	Fifty Shades of Grey	such a sick man	1
4804	Hulk	Haha.. what a mess!	0
4805	Van Helsing	This movie makes me really, really angry. I enjoy the cast, but some of the graphics... Eeeep. If I can identify where you get stock images from, or if I can shudder from bad edges, I just won't like the movie!	2
4806	Inception	Epic , gets better everytime i watch . A movie you can make your own . and that buzz i got when leaveing the cinema the 1st time i watched it will take some beating . Nolan Knows Moives . 	2
4807	Midnight's Children	This epic saga of magical realism was always destined to be a difficult adaptation to the big screen. It may have worked better as a mini series because so much of the novel was excised and many concepts and characters were abrogated. It also suffers from what I'd like to designate as the 'cloud atlas' effect. If you haven't read the novel some of the story can appear disjointed or many scenes unnecessary. I just think that if you want to tackle such a grandiose novel, do it right. Mediocre. 	0
4808	City of God	"Hella good.
"	2
4809	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	I genuinely believed it was an elaborate in-joke between 'berg & Lucas for atleast the first hour.	2
4810	The Big Lebowski	The Coen's best movie and one of the most unique I've seen	2
4811	Rampage	Watched just after Kong Skull Island. Better. At least has a story. Monster designs and effects are much better. Has a right amount of humor. But of course: yet another Hollywood waste of time...	0
4812	Pan's Labyrinth	my favorite movie EVER.	2
4813	eXistenZ	Did NOT blow my mind. Apparently this is a cult movie now? 	0
4814	Reservoir Dogs	a little too glib and violent, but brilliant at times	2
4815	Dirty Dancing	So incredibly over-rated.	1
4816	Mean Girls	is there anyone who doesnt love this movie?	2
4817	Theatre of Blood	Vincent Price's best role, in perhaps his most literate, well-written film.	2
4818	Along Came Polly	Very hilarous. I love this film but must be just a one shoot	1
4819	Dirty Dancing	a really good 80's movie	2
4820	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	There's some nifty shots in the first act, but once it goes into ARGHHH! I'M WET! for the last haf. Welcome to dullsville. 	2
4821	Dondurmam gaymak	Story of film is very similar to Ladri di Biciclette...	1

Love it!	2
4825	Nurse Betty	This movie rocks totally hard.  Morgan Freeman is dignified as always, but he's also going to kill you at any moment.	0
4826	The Long Day Closes	Rather than dabble in a straightforward narrative that would be easier to follow but occlude the things that really mattered, Terrence Davies films this story of his childhood in Malickian slice-of-life form. Sounds (like the titular song) and images (an overhead shot blending play, school, and religion) merge to form an impressionistic portrait that focuses on feelings rather than ideas. The result is one of the most powerful, honest, and sincere statements ever made in cinema.	2
4827	Gattaca	Great flick.	2
4828	Wreck-It Ralph	The first film with video game humor that wasn't a groan fest. Wreck It Ralph pulls you in with its in jokes but where the movie shines is oddly enough its original content it puts a spin on from original characters to originalish video games. An excellent job by Disney.	2
4829	Jaws	My all-time favourite 'creature' movie until KingKong came along to dethrone it! No CGI special-effects... no trickery... just pure 'creature' terror with great performances! The shark steals the show, though!	2
4830	Unbreakable	No matter how hard Mr. Shyamalan attempts to destroy his legacy in the medium, we will be able to look back and say that he made one great film: this one.	0
4831	Signs	They are only here to make noise	1
4832	Erin Brockovich	Love her or hate her, Julia Roberts deserved the praise she received for this film.  This based on a true story is definitely worth a watch.  Or 5 in my case.	2
4833	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Great movie if they ended it 10 minutes early	2
4834	Titanic	100 ? I must have been insane back in those days.	1
4835	T2 Trainspotting	Strangely I loved the second movie more. Just more of the same but even better. Choose life Veronica!	2
4836	Inception	Pure awesomeness.	1
4837	The Hate U Give	An important and powerful subject matter--but the film itself at times almost seems to present the characters as caricatures, and the acting and dialogue, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired all around...	0
4838	The Lobster	This is the worst movie I have ever experienced.  Vapid and overt satire about adult romantic relationships told in the most contrived and annoying fashion ever visualized via film.    	0
4839	Roma	Great at making you feel the emotions of the characters, personally I found the 	2
4840	There Will Be Blood	i wonder if you'd all think it was such a perfect movie if it hadn't won an oscar, golden globe and so on... yet it is a quite good movie, but sometimes too predictive and constructed to my mind	2
4841	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	This was a lower rating for me until I watched the special extended version. The 3:48 time spent watching makes a huge difference.	2
4842	Jaws	spooky, bloody, scary, bitey, sharkey.. need i say more.	1
4843	Four Weddings and a Funeral	Part of the British movie boom of the 90s and one of the few movies of that era that people still can name. With good reason, as it is one of the few romantic comedies that reach across the aisle and are watchable together. 	2
4844	Inglourious Basterds	I'm used to Tarantino movies not going far, (if you said you weren't bored at all for this you're lying) but this one seemed pointless. There's no metaphor, no insight; it's art for art's sake. I get it, you want a 3 hr Michael Bay film for the Sideways crowd. OK, but such a vapid movie doesn't deserve this setting, especially as its only used for suspense or humor. Stop focusing on the filmmaking, Tarantino, you can't see the forest for the trees. Nice cuts and angles alone don't win Oscars.	0
4845	Scream	Scream was such a dumb move. the villian was unbelieveable. his costume was pretty corny looking, and the story wasnt all that great. 	0
4846	2001: A Space Odyssey	I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that	0
4847	Mission: Impossible	All Tom Cruise films get a 0 because of his crazy beliefs.	1
4848	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	The best fantasy film ever made, and the start of the best fantasy trilogy ever made.	2
4849	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	it's one of the best vampire stories ever made by Hollywood! It's mellow.	2
4850	The Prestige	La guerre entre Hugh Jackman et Christian Bale est intense. Et la fin magnifique.	2
4851	Pacific Rim	its awsome	1
4852	The Tree of Life	I wish it was a joke.	0
4853	The Fifth Element	Completely over the top. I love it!	2
4854	Raiders of the Lost Ark	This is a truly great adventure movie.	2
4855	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	Very good adaption of the book.	2
4856	The Human Centipede (First Sequence)	Unsure whether to give it 10 or 90. The plot was ridiculously stupid. It was so poor, I actually laughed most of the way through it. It wasn't disgusting at all.	0
4857	The Grudge	meoooowwwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrrr	1
4858	Memento	You like, blew my mind, man.	1
4859	Pan's Labyrinth	An amazing movie, great story, wonderful acting.  I really admired how unflinching the director was; it's easy to imagine how a plot such as this could have been corrupted by a less skilled filmmaker.  This is what fantasy should be.  Also, this movie made me cry.  I love it!	2
4860	Shrek: The Musical	Absolute masterpiece. Some have called it the Citizen Kane of the 21st century. Now I see why.	1
4861	Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion	What Shunya ITO created with Sasori is definitively one of the best wip-flicks out there. Combining sleazy exploitation - including all needed elements from group showers to lesbian sex encounters to rape - and avantgarde-resque installments mostly using colour and theatre settings this is a bit more than the usual misogynic sleaze fest. Featuring the unique Meiko KAJI turning the damsel in distress-character into a dangerous damsel that kicks arse this is only topped by the second installment.	2
4862	American Psycho	Despite having a terrific premise - and a chillingly brilliant performance from Christian Bale - I felt the film essentially did nothing but establish a series of loose ends which it never tied up. As a character piece; and as an example of how queasy violence SHOULD be portrayed in film; this is a must-see. It's just a shame that the pay-out (or lack thereof) gave no hint of closure, which made the whole experience oddly unsatisfying when the credits rolled.	0
4863	Midnight in Paris	Love this movie.  Owen Wilson is great, the unfolding of the time changes is great, the interplay of historical figures is great, the scenery of Paris is great ( I accidentally stayed a few days near to one of the main locations).  Romantic, realistic view of love and hope and confusion  So Good. DramaFFlop rating:(see my profile for details)  Dialogue=5, Rudeness=5, Acting=4, Messages=3, Action=5, Funny=4, Filmography=5, Lovable Characters=4, Orchestration=4, Plot=5. WeightedScore =90	2
4864	The Notebook	nice romance!	2
4865	Catwoman	Why can't you give negative points?  This was a two hour abortion with lots of pain.	0
4866	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A great start to the Sequel trilogy. It looks & feels like a true Star Wars movie, and while it does borrow from the original it uses it to its advantage and it works well.	2
4867	Rescue Dawn	Capturing - in more than one meaning of the word	2
4868	Scrooged	Dear Bill Murray: please marry me.  Oh right, the movie.  This is one of my favorite adaptations of A Christmas Carol.  Bob Goldthwait does a good job of stealing every scene he's in.  When he and Bill are *both* on the screen, it's a thing of beauty.	2
4869	Baahubali: The Beginning	I just so thoroughly enjoyed this, objectivity went to hell.	2
4870	Starship Troopers	Perhaps my ranking is a little high, but so rarely are action and satirical comedy fused in such a brilliant way. Easily one of the best of the sci-fi action genre.  	2
4871	Forrest Gump	I hate this movie	0
4872	Warrior	By rights this should be a shitty movie considering how formulaic its description is, but it's so perfectly executed, with incredible acting, great direction, and possibly the best use of a band's music in film I've ever seen with The National.	2
4873	Cinderela Baiana	BIG. F*CKING. CLASSIC.	2
4874	Pan's Labyrinth	Incredible monsters from Guillermo Del Toro, impressive vision of the brain retreating into a fantasy world when the real one is too horrible to deal with.	2
4875	Adaptation.	double the cage, double the pleasure 	1
4876	Catwoman	Halle Berry is smoking in her BDSM spandex, but sadly the script and story are one of the worst I've witnessed. Only worth watching for eye candy.	0
4877	Synecdoche, New York	Charlie Kaufman you are my hero!	1
4878	The Tree of Life	A modern cinema. Breathtaking.	2
4879	Pan's Labyrinth	Ineffable, indelible, and profoundly literary; a Goyesque masterpiece. One of the best films I've ever seen, a rich text that merits considerable psychological, historical, artistic, and metaphysical reflection. I'm still trying to find expression to appreciate & interpret all I saw and heard. Just be aware that it's graphically violent, almost to the point of excess. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find myself accepting the profuse brutality as necessary for the story to assert its full power.	2
4880	I Heart Huckabees	Superb.  One of the most original movies I've seen in a long time.  Great script.  Solid acting.  Even a moral or two.  It's a shame that this flick didn't get better press.  I suppose one more sign of my general deviance.	1
4881	Beauty and the Beast	Probably sentimental bias as it is the earliest movie can remember going to the theater to see. I still consider it the best animated movie.	2
4882	Troy	I love well done mythological fantasy films.  This didn't quite get to the well done part.	2
4883	No Country for Old Men	Excellent movie.  All the characters are finely drawn and acted.  	2
4884	Scream	Classic.	2
4885	Memento	One of the best movies of all time.  Even after it is over you're never quite sure.	1
4886	The Room	SPOON!	1
4887	Amélie	I absolutely loved this movie!  The storyline, as well as the cinematography, pleased every human sense.  Humorous, sad, touching and playful, all at the same time.  Simply fantastic.	2
4888	The Crying Game	How I wish I looked that good as a woman.	1
4889	Ghost Rider	morning bonehead	1
4890	Wolf Creek	If someone gave you seven dollars to watch this movie, take it, but know you'll earn it.	0
4891	Pretty Woman	Nothin' says love like a hooker trying to bag a rich guy...	1
4892	Epic Movie	this movie was so bad it made me angry!!!	0
4893	Mysterious Skin	A harrowing yet magical film that follows the contrasting lives of two child abuse victims. For me, this film was only faulted in that Gordon-Levitt was not in every scene. I was aching to explore his character further to the point I was angry every time we left his story. Although I found our other protagonist  somewhat lacking in comparison, the character did grow and much of my negativity was redeemed with a heart wrenching- but not sentimental finale with the two boys. An important film.	0
4894	Ichi the Killer	Amazingly enough, this film delivers a stellar ultra violent plot with coherency.	2
4895	Big River Man	If you want to see one documentary this year, do yourself a favour and see this one. It is so beautiful, moving and inspirational unlike anything i've seen in recent times. I've known quite a bit about the man covered in the story, but after seeing it, i can only say i was even more blown away and truly admire people achieving something even with incredible obstacles (personal, mental and physical) ahead of them.	2
4896	Once Upon a Time in Anatolia	great film but mysoginistic.	2
4897	The Bourne Identity	Boring.  I remember the books being much more interesting.	1
4898	Heima	I love sigur ros and i'd loved this documentary.	2
4899	Inception	Everyone says this is a mind you-know-what. And that's true. The part I like best is it raises Matrix-level questions. Is this real?	2
4900	Juno	Cute, that's all.	2
4901	Kong: Skull Island	This is the movie Jurassic World wanted to be. Epic, loud, and visually incredible action all blended together in a fun script with likable characters. Every shot is gorgeous, the mountains of Vietnam and colors of the swamp especially pop out and look stunning. The ultimate monster summer movie. I enjoyed the Vietnam aesthetic too. See it now. STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!	2
4902	The Comfort of Strangers	A hard to rate erotic horror. It's almost something great, but it just can't quite pull greatness off. The scenery is beautiful, the concept is interesting, the dialogue is great, and the acting is wonderful. The editing, plotting and pacing, however, is where the film fails. It has several great setups and promises that it just never really delivers on. It has great atmosphere, but it ends up being just that, atmosphere without the needed substance to bring it together. Ultimately, forgettable.	0
4903	The Room	Never has a movie been this astonishing.	0
4904	The 40-Year-Old Virgin	The dialogue in this movie has nice flow and the character interactions feel genuine. It has a good pace with a decent soundtrack and a fun but predictable story. I'd watch it again if it aired on TV.	2
4905	Wreck-It Ralph	a fun take on video games	2
4906	Manos: The Hands of Fate	Yes! I gave MAOS a 90!!! HAHAHAHA!!!!	1
4907	The Lego Movie	"Probable Score
Awesome!"	2
4908	Saw	looks like a bad heavy metal video. 	0
4909	Mulan	On of Disney's classics, but due to some clunky storytelling and the ever so annoyance of disney botching cultures it is not perfection.	0
4910	2001: A Space Odyssey	One movie I will never understand the love for, sure it has some really good moments during the middle of the movie and I love, love, love the whole shutting down of Hal scene and it is impressive visually for its time but I found most of it especially the whole ending sequence to be really boring.	2
4911	Pineapple Express	A pile of shit with a poor script - not funny.	0
4912	Coherence	Good movie to keep your attention. Definitely a weird little twist. 	2
4913	The Silence of the Lambs	Good classic movie. A little too slow for my taste, yet it is pretty enjoyable.	2
4914	Ender's Game	Was a bit rushed. I thought the characters should have been more developed, and they glossed over some important relationships and time periods, but they didn't stray far from the book and it was visually  impressive. Great story, although paraphrased. Overall a satisfying adaption.	2
4915	Twister	Another guilty pleasure.	2
4916	Snatch	A rewatchable film with quick pace and well intertwined storylines, dry,  black humour and enjoyable action scenes.	2
4917	The Irishman	Scorsese proves again that he's still capable of repeating himself. I'm getting a little tired of it, though...	1
4918	The Artist	Some movies have a nice, meaningful story to tell. Some movies are beautifully made, and deliver a wonderful sensory experience. And some movies appeal to your feelings in a way that leaves you in a good mood after they've finished. This has the three, it's in black and white, and all the dialog could be written on a couple sheets of paper. What can I say, this was pretty impressive.	0
4919	Mr. Holland's Opus	Beautiful story of an ordinary life.	2
4920	Dances with Wolves	Excellent historical saga.  Deserving of Oscar.	2
4921	Raiders of the Lost Ark	The quintessential action film.	2
4922	District 9	Awesome. Surprising in its turns and violence. Our hero being an antihero only caring about himself. And with a strong message as to how we treat refugees, or people who are different. 	2
4923	Hero	A visually stunning film with excellent performances from the cast and a compelling story.	2
4924	E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial	love it, used to scare me when he was in the bushes aaaah	1
4925	The Matrix	Amazing, mysterious, psychological, philosophical. If you ever questioned reality, and wonder if the future of humanity will pan out for the positive, than this is for you. Ignore the sequels. 	2
4926	The Descent	no distracting stars in the film; all good actors. makes you claustrophobic. just terrifying wondering what you are going to see down in the dark.	1
4927	Serenity	Great ending to a fabulous series! It was great to see the characters again and to see the story wrapping up nicely. Great action, dialogue and effects.	2
4928	Taxi Driver	De Niro - Scorsese - Coolness. Nothing more to say... 	2
4929	The Wicker Man	"I'm proud to say I have given 'The Wicker Man' one of it's highest ratings on this website.
It's absolutely awful. But so what? It's Nicolas Cage in a bear suit punching women!
HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!"	0
4930	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	One of my favorites! I love LOTR! ROTK was a little long though, and so it's hard to sit through some parts... but it is a dang good movie overall.	2
4931	Night at the Museum	Pretty clever, well-done, and only a little predictable. A nice family movie.	2
4932	Dumb and Dumber	one of my favorite comedies	2
4933	Jaws	Classic movie. 	2
4934	Validation	I couldn't despise it more. Moronic.	0
4935	The Fifth Element	I have absolutely no idea what it is about this movie but I adore it. Whenever I see it on TV I make a point of watching it. It's a campy fun sci-fi movie and that's all I ask it to be. 	0
4936	Kill Bill: Volume 1	Wanted to love it, but the fights are terrible and the story is the same as Steven Seagal's Hard To Kill. When you're ripping off a Seagal film it's time to pack it in.	2
4937	The Birds	the best horror film ever 	2
4938	Raiders of the Lost Ark	One of the greatest movies of all time, and the start of my lifelong crush on Harrison Ford.	2
4939	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	There are those movies like Psycho who get better with age, and then there is this. Given its shocking content, it is perfectly understandable why the movie may have been somewhat influential at the time of its release. Nevertheless, had the film been released today, not only would it not stand out, it would epitomize everything that's wrong about the horror genre (awful acting, script and dialogues). In fact, these weaknesses made the movie hilarious at times, but for all the bad reasons.	0
4940	Mona Lisa	interesting, dark, innocet	2
4941	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Completes the story with awesome battle scenes and great acting.	2
4942	Jurassic Park	You have to admire it technically but there's not much else to admire.	1
4943	Hudson Hawk	Vastly underrated post-modern fun-fest. Yo.	2
4944	The English Patient	I really like sand	1
4945	Taken	I was looking really forward to this movie and i wasnt dissapointed when i got the time to watch it. It had some dubious dialogues but thats okay, cause Liam Neeson is really kicking it. Really enjoyed it.	2
4946	Marley & Me	i dont think i ever cried so hard watching a movie	0
4947	Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid	was this any different than the first one?	1
4948	Y Tu Mamá También	One of the greatest road-movies ever made.	2
4949	Inception	Awesome, baya iyiydi.	2
4950	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	One of THE BEST films of all time, and my personal favorite. Johnny Depp is amazing in this.	2
4951	Reign of Fire	Dragons, combat helicopters, savior Americans and dinosaur apocalypse. A true love-hate combination.	2
4952	Roma	Simple plot, but a tremendous sensitivity. The shooting of the scenery is fantastic! Very good.	2
4953	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Beautiful film. When is a human a human? When, if ever, it is ok to kill someone?	2
4954	The Princess Bride	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.	1
4955	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	Intense and entertaining, thoroughly enjoyed it. Great performances by Brad Pitt and (suprisingly) Tom Cruise, as well as a young Kirsten Dunst. Highly recommend it!	2
4956	Jumanji	Great family film. One of Robin Williams finest movies.	2
4957	Pearl Harbor	Horrible movie, it got an even lower score than I first thought because I thought it was a slap in the face to the people that lived through it.  The namesake of the movie is a minor aspect to this trash	0
4958	The Fountain	Hauntingly beautiful !	2
4959	Tales from Earthsea	I can't help loving the atmosphere but story is so weak that it breaks my heart to see Tales from Earthsea title on it. 	1
4960	The Umbrellas of Cherbourg	Unique French musical with enchanting music by Michel Legrand and poetic lyrics and direction by Jacques Demy. One of the most romantic films ever made.	2
4961	Husbands	Cassavetes, Falk, AND Gazzara!	1
4962	Encino Man	minus 60 points for pauly shore	1
4963	Adaptation.	Kaufman's best	2
4964	The Lone Ranger	A terrible framing device and an incredibly annoying, and not to mention racist, Johnny Depp mar what is honestly a somewhat entertaining action western.	0
4965	The Big Lebowski	A few draggy parts, but overall, fun	2
4966	The Big Lebowski	The Coen's best movie and one of the most unique I've seen	2
4967	Rampage	Watched just after Kong Skull Island. Better. At least has a story. Monster designs and effects are much better. Has a right amount of humor. But of course: yet another Hollywood waste of time...	0
4968	Pan's Labyrinth	my favorite movie EVER.	2
4969	eXistenZ	Did NOT blow my mind. Apparently this is a cult movie now? 	0
4970	The Warriors	"Good: Everyone is in a gang, they say wasted instead of dead...
Bad: Characters, plot"	0
4971	God Help the Girl	God help the spectator.	0
4972	Goodfellas	Greatest movie ever made?	2
4973	Clouds of May	this reminded me of my childhood, the games i played with my cousins, walking in the fields, my grandfather and grandmother, the whole family gathering up and talking, innocent things, things that will not happen again..	2
4974	Camille	Why do such rare gems never come out in the theatres?	2
4975	Audition	I love this movie, but there's only about 20 minutes of actual suspense/interesting parts. The rest is incredibly boring.	2
4976	Marriage Story	Pros: All the acting (especially Driver); direction; tone  Cons: N/A	1
4977	Drive	While it embraced a lot of modern themes that will draw in the casual crowd, there are notes of existentialism and character study in this to make it deeper than most. Very well acted.	2
4978	The Talented Mr. Ripley	Paid for the whole seat, but I only needed the edge. Yeah...	0
4979	Hero	"(pt-br)
http://filmedodia.net/fdd298-hero2002-heroi"	1
4980	Foxy Brown	Fun but nowhere near the same league as Coffy. 	0
4981	Frankenstein	Bit of a mess - James Whale hadn't got a handle yet on how to balalnce the Ruritanian comedy vs. horror elements. But Karloff is amazing ( just his ARM is amazing in one scene), and Colin Clive's prissy performance is classic camp.	2
4982	Amadeus	The closest a film has ever gotten to perfection.The direction is just superb,the acting is excellent,the script, and how could I not mention the amazing set design.This film is almost perfect in every area.Highly recommended.	2
4983	Carnival of Souls	It's like a dream. Easy to see the influence on later directors	2
4984	The Descent	despite everyone's protestations to the contrary, not intelligent	1
4985	The Haunting of Hill House	Terrible writing, mediocre acting, definitely not scary. 	0
4986	The Notebook	Film to make someone wet.	0
4987	Martyrs	Impeccably made. Possibly the best 'horror' film of the modern era. At the same time Martyrs is the first movie I've seen which genuinely fits the moral panic moniker 'torture porn'. From the opening scenes of a small child's terror at an invisible threat, to the finales decent into incomprehensible violence and grotesquery, Martyrs is a dark feast of unforgettable images and nightmarish ideas. 	2
4988	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	I don't think this story was meant for movie-format, but I thought that the director did a good job. It isn't the same experience as the book, but I love the story in itself so much that it was difficult not to enjoy the movie.	1
4989	The Irishman	Lost interest somewhere half way through, never really got the feel of what the whole thing was about, and the time jumps didn't fit in. Great cast and photo but this CGI youth serum thingy was kind of ridiculous and poorly made, or the effect itself was nice but when De Niro moving around as the 80(?) year old he is it doesn't matter if his face looks like 30. Like when he was beating up that shop owner and kicking him to the curb, it looked like he was using a walking chair while doing it :D	0
4990	The Lobster	This is the worst movie I have ever experienced.  Vapid and overt satire about adult romantic relationships told in the most contrived and annoying fashion ever visualized via film.    	0
4991	Roma	Great at making you feel the emotions of the characters, personally I found the 	2
4992	ThanksKilling	A better horror satire than any of the Scary Movies.	0
4993	Batman Begins	Excellent, excellent  film. Very much a breath taker, i named my cat batman after seeing it, was much impressed. ofcourse not the deepest around, it shows a nice version of the batman mythology, and directed with panache and energy. Great!	2
4994	In the Mood for Love	A sensual poem constructed with few words and many images.	2
4995	Aladdin	not my fave disney cartoon for sure....	0
4996	The Mummy	Incredible. Kinda freaky kind of adventurey, the British chick was hot and her brother was funny. The mummy's powers are cool. 	2
4997	Jaws	my favorite film of all time. Never been more terrified than when I saw this for the first time at the age of 6.	1
4998	Fitzcarraldo	This movie proves, at least, the bizarre genius of Klaus Kinski. He plays this warm and mostly pleasant character, that differs enormously not only from his previous experiences with the director Werner Herzog (Aguirre, Nosferatu and Woyzeck) but from his own personality. Yet, Kinski's able to build a dense and problematic hero, bringing the character to another level of complexity but the classic epochality.	2
4999	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom	Y'know what would be great: a Jurassic Park movie set mostly in a single building, said nobody ever.	1
5000	Valley Girl	Clearly the most 80's film ever made, but it's near perfectly executed.	2
5001	Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	The best Star Wars film. 	2
5002	Avengers: Endgame	I enjoyed this movie so much.... I will remember it and definatelly watch it numerous times. For sure it was not perfect, but I really do not have any complaints.	2
5003	Hero	Excellent chinese epic. Finally Jet-Li makes a really good movie. Keep trying...	2
5004	Shutter Island	This is not my favorite Martin Scorsese movie, but I had a really good time while watching this movie. This movie starts as a mystery movie and changes to something different and that's what I liked about it. I was so entertained by performances of so many great actors and actresses. The story may be predictable but I don't think the story was the main focus of this movie. Ben Kingsley was fantastic in this movie. This movie is so well crafted I was so engaged into the movie from start to end.	1
5005	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Original, funny, clever and all around fun.	2
5006	Captain Marvel	Larson is great. A very confident performance not  appreciated by too many. Her chemistry with Jackson is superb.   Despite being a standard origin story the film tries some different things. The start of the film has some poor jokes and a couple of clunky lines of dialogue but after that it's mostly very enjoyable.  Captain Marvel doesn't go through many individual struggles, and there could've been more for her, but the tension of the film comes from the safety of the side characters. 	1
5007	Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason	Nice movie if you're in the mood for a lot of humour.	2
5008	Commando	mindless action flick. watch for arnold	0
5009	Narcos	1. ve 2. Sezon	1
5010	Blow-Up	one of the best movies ever made without a doubt, antonioni perfectly matches a co-relation between reality and ilussion and the result is of course breathtaking and possisional between many similitudes as real life situations could get, how a photoghraper manages to see life between his art and how he manages to comprehend it is stunning; visually beautiful and in terms of meaningful state you get comprehend the concept of loneliness and how much fissures can cause in your daily life.	2
5011	Bamboozled	this is a difficult film 	0
5012	The Cat in the Hat	too much sexual inuendo and swearing for a movie marketed to kids.	0
5013	Antichrist	The film which is extremely hard to watch but somehow makes you realize to be one of the best you have ever seen. Trier shows the very dark side of the human nature, the irrational force which lies in the bottom of all of us. 	2
5014	Gravity	Great scenes, great actress	2
5015	The Big Lebowski	I love how absurd the story is, and how it manages to be a really funny film all centered on a rug that was peed x), the dude just wanted his rug back D:	2
5016	Sully	Sully (2016) An excellent bio-pic of the events of Nov. 14, 2014, Sully employs the back-story of the hearings by the FAA and the NTSB with both real-life footage and re-enactments of those same events. Director Clint Eastwood weaves an interesting story where one stays focused and involved. Very fine acting by Tom Hanks (Capt. Chesely Sully Sullenberger), Aaron Eckhart (as first officer Jeff Skiles), Laura Linney (Lorrie Sullenberger, the pilot's wife) and a good supporting cast h	2
5017	Godzilla	Critics dog-piled this movie.  It was like they all wanted to be the one who said the worst things about it.  It wasn't the worst thing since Hitler, it just wasn't especially good.  	0
5018	The Way Back	Terrible anti-communist propaganda movie. I hated the political idea underneath the movie. Germany-US-Russia-England all of them was equally guilty on behalf of humanity. In this movie Russians and Germans shown as Evil and US and English shown as freedom fighters. Savers of humanity. It is a terrible cold war propaganda movie.	0
5019	District 9	First half is absurd, disgusting, even funny at times. Surprisingly, it turns out to be quite a nice action movie with more depth and emotion one would expect after that first hour or so.	0

5028	About Time	An interest premise and good performances by the actors ruined by an extremely weak script.	0
5029	Back to the Future Part II	Maximum entertainment.	1
5030	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	One of THE BEST films of all time, and my personal favorite. Johnny Depp is amazing in this.	2
5031	Reign of Fire	Dragons, combat helicopters, savior Americans and dinosaur apocalypse. A true love-hate combination.	2
5032	Roma	Simple plot, but a tremendous sensitivity. The shooting of the scenery is fantastic! Very good.	2
5033	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Beautiful film. When is a human a human? When, if ever, it is ok to kill someone?	2
5034	The Princess Bride	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.	1
5035	Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles	Intense and entertaining, thoroughly enjoyed it. Great performances by Brad Pitt and (suprisingly) Tom Cruise, as well as a young Kirsten Dunst. Highly recommend it!	2

5040	Week End	incredibly over-rated	1
5041	City of God	Great movie in all the aspects.	2
5042	Mr. Deeds	Probably a middle of the pack Adam Sandler. Surprisingly similar to 50 first dates in style.	1
5043	The Shape of Water	The fish-god character is so thinly drawn that this felt like watching Sally Hawkins' character masturbate in her tub for two hours. Felt absolutely nothing about the central romance.  Also, shockingly bad dialogue, especially for a Best Picture winner. The general's dressing-down of Michael Shannon was just incomprehensible and bizarre.	0
5044	Disaster Movie	no.	0
5045	Underworld	Was allright, but could hav ebeen much better. I expected a lot out of this movie and was left feeling like the story wasn't told properly	0

5047	Deep Blue Sea	Only one reason to see this movie, Samuel L. Jackson's big scene.	1
5048	Melancholia	I've seen worse but still... WTF is this?	0
5049	Amadeus	This movie is awesome with amazing music. I mean it's Mozart.	2
5050	The Incredibles	Great family fun	2
5051	Any Given Sunday	"When watching a film based on the events of a sport team, theres is always a feeling that despite how enjoyable the opening two thirds are, it will inevitably disappoint, as the ending can only follow two routes, they're gonna win or they're gonna lose.
  
  Of course this film cannot conjure up any additional options but it provides an ending that is both inspiring to fit the awesome Pacino monologue without feeling like a forced happy ending.
  
  Gripping from start to the twist of a finish."	2
5052	All the Real Girls	my favorite movie about relationships by one of my favorite directors.  	2
5053	Shrek: The Musical	Absolute masterpiece. Some have called it the Citizen Kane of the 21st century. Now I see why.	1
5054	Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion	What Shunya ITO created with Sasori is definitively one of the best wip-flicks out there. Combining sleazy exploitation - including all needed elements from group showers to lesbian sex encounters to rape - and avantgarde-resque installments mostly using colour and theatre settings this is a bit more than the usual misogynic sleaze fest. Featuring the unique Meiko KAJI turning the damsel in distress-character into a dangerous damsel that kicks arse this is only topped by the second installment.	2
5055	American Psycho	Despite having a terrific premise - and a chillingly brilliant performance from Christian Bale - I felt the film essentially did nothing but establish a series of loose ends which it never tied up. As a character piece; and as an example of how queasy violence SHOULD be portrayed in film; this is a must-see. It's just a shame that the pay-out (or lack thereof) gave no hint of closure, which made the whole experience oddly unsatisfying when the credits rolled.	0
5056	Midnight in Paris	Love this movie.  Owen Wilson is great, the unfolding of the time changes is great, the interplay of historical figures is great, the scenery of Paris is great ( I accidentally stayed a few days near to one of the main locations).  Romantic, realistic view of love and hope and confusion  So Good. DramaFFlop rating:(see my profile for details)  Dialogue=5, Rudeness=5, Acting=4, Messages=3, Action=5, Funny=4, Filmography=5, Lovable Characters=4, Orchestration=4, Plot=5. WeightedScore =90	2
5057	The Notebook	nice romance!	2
5058	Catwoman	Why can't you give negative points?  This was a two hour abortion with lots of pain.	0
5059	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A great start to the Sequel trilogy. It looks & feels like a true Star Wars movie, and while it does borrow from the original it uses it to its advantage and it works well.	2
5060	Van Gogh	Pialat's masterpiece. Jacques Dutronc portrays the best Van Gogh on screen ever.  A film of flesh and fury. 	2
5061	Children of Men	"Being one of the few movies that can actually make me cry, Alfonso Cuarón has made a great movie from this novel (which I haven't read).
With its intensely long takes and great cinematography, the movie tells a very honest human story."	2
5062	Bad Boys II	This movie is just a string of ridiculous action setups. This makes it an amazing movie to watch if you have 5.1 surround and at least a 57 HDTV. It has at LEAST 4 car chases, all of them visually impressive... If you just want pure unadulterated action, watch this 2.5 hour movie.	2
5063	The Talented Mr. Ripley	Great acting from the leads, storyline of win!	2
5064	District 9	A good message,people think it's very complicated,but was very simple to me.	1
5065	The Incredibles 2	Weak feminist propoganda.	0
5066	The Shooting	I wish there was an infinite supply of Monte Hellman/Warren Oates collabs. Great existential western that does a lot with its miniscule budget.	2
5067	Waking Life	Easily my most hated movie of all time.	0
5068	Juno	Fuck you and fuck your burger phone.	1
5069	Johnny Mnemonic	The most unintentionally hilarious film of all time. 	2
5070	The Virgin Spring	Absolutely one of the most emotional and heartbreaking films I've ever seen.	2
5071	Cougars, Inc.	Only good thing about this movie is James Belushi. The rest is one of the worst movies ever, including some soft porn in a way you won't like it.	0
5072	Pink Flamingos	stomach wrenching ugliness that you can't tear your eyes away from.. interesting but grotesquely haunting.. shit eating fun for the whole family.. 	2
5073	Child's Play 2	Fabulous. Classic. Chucky never lets me down.	2
5074	City of God	Excellent movie!	2
5075	The Killing	Stanley Kubrick's The Killing is a clever and brisk crime film with plenty of twists.	2
5076	Cloverfield	"Not a particular good movie, but the experience of watching it at a cinema boosted the score a bit. It's completely terrifying at moments. It's a good showcase of the human side of a monster invasion. No scientists in white coats to save the day by revealing the weakness just at the end.

Probably the best monster movie there is, which doesn't say a whole lot."	1
5077	Tales from Earthsea	I can't help loving the atmosphere but story is so weak that it breaks my heart to see Tales from Earthsea title on it. 	1
5078	Forrest Gump	A classic.  Great story.  	2
5079	Atomic Blonde	One-shot action sequence and worn out mc after fight really sold me on this movie	0
5080	Gladiator	great movie, great musics...	2

5082	The Big Lebowski	The Dude. 'Nuff said.	1
5083	Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog	great musical!	2
5084	God's Not Dead	Much like the movie, I wonder if the ratings given here are for the movie or for God. 	1
5085	Reign of Fire	It's got angry dragons. But it's still a bit meh.	2
5086	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	If this movie had ended when he jumped into the water, it would have had a much higher score.	0
5087	Marketa Lazarová	"Try to imagine medieval men and women as they were, and not as people of the XXIth centurey dressed in medieval clothes. Try to understand how they though, how they loved, how they believe in God (or gods), how they had fear and honor and greed.
 Add the image genius of a Kurosawa or a Leone, the mysticism of a Bergman, a lanscinant music, the beauty of Czech plains...
 This is Marketa Lazarova, one of the best movie ever made."	2
5088	Igby Goes Down	Jeff Goldblum with his pants down SHOULD be an automatic 100...	0
5089	From Hell	A travesty of a graphic novel adaptation. Alan Moore is spinning in his grave and he isn't even dead yet. None of the brilliance of the graphic novel was translated to the film and it proved that Johnny Depp cannot save every crappy movie that he's in.	0
5090	Harold and Maude	A classic!  	2
5091	Hero	beautiful!	2
5092	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	This movie is an absolute gem. As a loose adaptation of Odyssey starring a strangely well cast George Clooney and Jonh Turturruo, the movie entertains from beginning to end, with plenty of laughs and great music along the way.  John Goodman steals every scene he's in as the big talking Bible salesman Big Dan Teague	2
5093	The Way, Way Back	İzlemeyen birşey kaybetmez.	1
5094	Ace Ventura: Pet Detective	Jim Carrey's comedies have a certain something to them - they're good fun, but they don't stay fresh after a lot of viewings. Ace Ventura was kind of his breakout performance, and it was a decent showcase of his style. It may not go down in history as his best film, but it will go down as one of his most notable characters.	1
5095	Shaun of the Dead	Really good zombie movie, different than others in many ways. Be prepared to be surprised, this zombies are not the ones you know	2
5096	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Stupid movie for stupid people	0
5097	Napoleon Dynamite	Most overrrated movie EVER. The plot doesn't even seem to exist. Other than a few laughable lines or moments it's boring as they come. The climax comes and goes without you even knowing and then you get to the end and say, That's considered a movie? Don't buy the hype and waste your time.	0
5098	Hero	A masterpiece. Brilliant and beautiful. Visually stunning. Emotionally powerful. Action packed. Excellently choreographed. An epic retelling of a legendary piece of Chinese culture and history.	2
5099	The Revenant	my rating goes to bear attackt scene 	1
5100	Akira	I really enjoy this movie.	2
5101	Eye in the Sky	This film offers engaging drama and a genuinely compelling moral problem that the audience must grapple with. The problem is that if one analyses the reality of the drone war in the real world, the film scans as basically pro-war propaganda. It would be fantastic if the real-life drone war were waged with as much concern for innocent civilians as depicted in the film. Similarly, the real-life drone war is waged with very flimsy and uncertain intelligence capabilities compared to the film.	0
5102	The Matrix	great change of pace in the american life style with this movie	2

5106	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	Very good adaption of the book.	2
5107	The Human Centipede (First Sequence)	Unsure whether to give it 10 or 90. The plot was ridiculously stupid. It was so poor, I actually laughed most of the way through it. It wasn't disgusting at all.	0

5116	Guardians of the Galaxy	A lighter tone, a great soundtrack, and overall fun makes this the best Marvel movie to date.	2
5117	The Wrestler	A genuine portrayl of the independant wrestling circuit which is equally grueling as it is fruitless.	2
5118	Once Upon a Time in America	Serves as a perfect example of how adept and proficient Sergio Leone was as a director. I thought this movie would be more like a sweeping epic gangster movie similar to The Godfather. In a way it is, but more often than not it isn't. The two movies frequently contrast and differ with each other. I'm not sure if it's even fair to compare the two because the two films are aiming to accomplish different agendas and both follow distinct paths. The ambiguity and various forms of symbolism presented 	0

Do not read a summary, do not try to know what it's about, and you'll see one of the most beautiful documentaries ever. 
You will laugh, you will get uplifted, you will feel rage and anger and at the same time feel like your life could be so much more... 
The only problems are the terrible images and the tear-jerking scene at the end, but otherwise, it's a must see."	2
5122	Memento	great script and it's shot in such an original way. great plot twists and creative scenes.	2
5123	John Wick	Glory for 80's movies and B-class films. 	2
5124	The Grudge	Sure, lots of people die.  But it's not scary, or good.  In fact, I'd have to say it's one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while.  Including some made by middle school students.	0

5126	Pretty Woman	Nothin' says love like a hooker trying to bag a rich guy...	1
5127	Epic Movie	this movie was so bad it made me angry!!!	0
5128	Mysterious Skin	A harrowing yet magical film that follows the contrasting lives of two child abuse victims. For me, this film was only faulted in that Gordon-Levitt was not in every scene. I was aching to explore his character further to the point I was angry every time we left his story. Although I found our other protagonist  somewhat lacking in comparison, the character did grow and much of my negativity was redeemed with a heart wrenching- but not sentimental finale with the two boys. An important film.	0
5129	Ichi the Killer	Amazingly enough, this film delivers a stellar ultra violent plot with coherency.	2
5130	Unfriended	The concept/idea is great, but the execution is very poor. This movie is not worth to be called horror or suspense, because nothing remotely exciting ever happens. You keep waiting for it, but it never comes. This movie is juvinile, has terrible dialogue and is most of all a big let down. The 'plot' is the worst one ever. Very bad movie from start to finish. They could have done so much more with this concept.	0
5131	The Light Bulb Conspiracy	This is not a conspiracy! This is the plain truth and stuff is learned in design and industry schools! Don't let the headline fool you - this is a very good educational film that shows how so many of us follow the foolish pattern of the consumption trend that made so many generations fixated with buying things they don't need with money they don't have, just to keep the growth going	0

5133	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	smell, the sense with no memory...this movie would lose nothing if it were just the naration with a slideshow of stills...don't ask why, especially a serial killer. 	0
5134	Hero	Beautifully shot and well acted. The story was a welcome change from the typical kung fu revenge flick. 	2
5135	Adaptation.	My life on film. On film.	1
5136	The Big Lebowski	Perhaps the Coen Brothers best work, after Fargo. A witty script, some great performances and a surprisingly solid narrative and ending make The Big Lebowski a wonderful, fun watch. 	2
5137	Munich	Spielberg's lessons in morality are great...if you're 9 years old.	2
5138	Zootopia	"Perfection!
"	2
5139	Inception	Honestly i don't know what i can say to praise this film that every other film critic hasn't. A masterful work by the director Christopher Nolan, this is hailed by many as his best film to date (so close Interstellar, yet so far). This movie plays out like one giant thriller puzzle, and we humans love solving puzzles. Or, at least, trying then getting it explained to. The cast is excellent, helmed by the talented DiCaprio. Epic set pieces and a moving plot make this movie a win in my book.	2
5140	Deadpool	An good film made bad, by a low budget	2
5141	The Revenant	Some of the best camera work of any movie I've seen, especially during moments of action. Very fluid and immersive. Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.   Spectacular lighting. The story and characters lack complexity, but it excels in everything it tries to achieve. 	2
5142	Toy Story	Pixar's very first movie. Its animation completely changed how cartoon movies are made.	2
5143	Aliens	What makes this film so good is not just the great cast, sets and storyline, but also the spot-on pacing. For that reason it's best to avoid the directors cut and stick with the theatrical version.	2
5144	Murder on the Orient Express	If you watched Sherlock Holmes (2009), which is hard not to compare with, this one is less dramatic, less dark, less intense, less polished, and a bit less fluent. Do depending on your mood it can be better or worse. The strong point of the movie is that it's easy to watch, enjoyable, without being a stupid show movie. The weak point is that I won't watch it again or remember it much.	0
5145	The Incredibles	Great family fun	2
5146	Any Given Sunday	"When watching a film based on the events of a sport team, theres is always a feeling that despite how enjoyable the opening two thirds are, it will inevitably disappoint, as the ending can only follow two routes, they're gonna win or they're gonna lose.
  
  Of course this film cannot conjure up any additional options but it provides an ending that is both inspiring to fit the awesome Pacino monologue without feeling like a forced happy ending.
  
  Gripping from start to the twist of a finish."	2
5147	All the Real Girls	my favorite movie about relationships by one of my favorite directors.  	2
5148	Shrek: The Musical	Absolute masterpiece. Some have called it the Citizen Kane of the 21st century. Now I see why.	1
5149	Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion	What Shunya ITO created with Sasori is definitively one of the best wip-flicks out there. Combining sleazy exploitation - including all needed elements from group showers to lesbian sex encounters to rape - and avantgarde-resque installments mostly using colour and theatre settings this is a bit more than the usual misogynic sleaze fest. Featuring the unique Meiko KAJI turning the damsel in distress-character into a dangerous damsel that kicks arse this is only topped by the second installment.	2
5150	T2 Trainspotting	Strangely I loved the second movie more. Just more of the same but even better. Choose life Veronica!	2
5151	Inception	Pure awesomeness.	1
5152	The Hate U Give	An important and powerful subject matter--but the film itself at times almost seems to present the characters as caricatures, and the acting and dialogue, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired all around...	0
5153	The Lobster	This is the worst movie I have ever experienced.  Vapid and overt satire about adult romantic relationships told in the most contrived and annoying fashion ever visualized via film.    	0
5154	Roma	Great at making you feel the emotions of the characters, personally I found the 	2
5155	ThanksKilling	A better horror satire than any of the Scary Movies.	0
5156	Batman Begins	Excellent, excellent  film. Very much a breath taker, i named my cat batman after seeing it, was much impressed. ofcourse not the deepest around, it shows a nice version of the batman mythology, and directed with panache and energy. Great!	2
5157	In the Mood for Love	A sensual poem constructed with few words and many images.	2
5158	Aladdin	not my fave disney cartoon for sure....	0
5159	The Mummy	Incredible. Kinda freaky kind of adventurey, the British chick was hot and her brother was funny. The mummy's powers are cool. 	2
5160	Mad Max: Fury Road	great action, great characters, all around great movie	2
5161	Pride & Prejudice	Beautiful story, beautiful acting, beautiful score, beautiful cinematography. Truly wonderful film. The actors manage to deliver even the occasionally superhumanly witty dialogue in a manner that keeps it convincing. Also, I remember reading the actors of the Bennett characters having said that it felt like they were a real family. It shows.	2
5162	Sin City	nice.	2
5163	Enter the Void	boring. pretentious. slow. The screensaver/fractal art may have been cool for a few seconds, but not minutes at a time (ARE YOU SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME) didn't finish	0
5164	Napapiirin sankarit	Finland in a nutshell ;)	1
5165	Magnolia	At least the music was good.	2
5166	The Revenant	It's a great film to watch if you enjoy frontier type movies.  Cinematography is fantastic, bear scene was unbelievably realistic and well done. Captures subtle themes of racism of the time, revenge and paternal parenthood. As well as the drive the human spirit has to survive and the brutality of traveling the frontier.     I loved it. 	2
5167	Dogma	The best comedy of 1999! Very smart, very funny, very capturing. Dogma and Shrek are the two movies that made me realize Terry Partchett should not be that hard to film.	2
5168	Godzilla	I don't understand the praise for this movie.  The movie had too many plot holes.  The characters were boring, one dimensional and forgettable.  By the time Godzilla makes it onto the screen, it's too little too late.  The only good thing the movie has going is the top notch special effects.    	0
5169	John Wick: Chapter 2	Never looked at a pencil the same way again after watching this movie.	0
5170	eXistenZ	eXistenZ came out the same year as The Matrix and the two films get compared to each other quite a bit. I love The Matrix but I have a soft spot for eXistenZ, which is kind of like it's nerdy little brother. It has a funky energy and a momentum that keeps you guessing right up until the last scene. Like most Cronenberg movies, it's obsessed with human anatomy and modern technology, and explores the different ways that these two fetishes intersect. It's sexy and gross and that's why I like it. 	2
5171	Shaun of the Dead	Frost and Pegg at their finest.	2
5172	Mad Max: Fury Road	The most overrated movie ever.	1
5173	Shaun of the Dead	The perfect zombie comedy!	2
5174	God Bless America	This was such a great film. If you liked the trailer, I can guarantee you will love the actually movie much more.  Highly recommend. 	2
5175	Catwoman	A movie that everyone should miss.	0
5176	Jurassic Park	This scared the crap out of me as a kid.	0
5177	Galaxy Quest	This is what should have happened to Shatner.	0
5178	The Hudsucker Proxy	A hugely under-appreciated gem from the Coens.  Tim Robbins is loveable as the country boy drafted into Hudsucker's top job by a reptilian Paul Newman, enjoying himself immensely in a comic role.  Jennifer Jason Leigh was often criticized for her Kathryn Hepburn/Rosalind Russell impression, but her verbal rat-a-tat-tat work well against the backdrop of one of the Coen's most visually entertaining movies.	2
5179	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	One of the best of Cameron, with a perfect mix of humor, action, and science-fiction !	2
5180	Loving Vincent	Sanatımla insanlara dokunmak istiyorum. desinler ki; ne kadar derin ne kadar hassas hissediyor. Vincent Van Gogh	1
5181	Logan	an ambitious story and great action but it felt joyless.	1
5182	X-Men: Days of Future Past	love this movie; makes me wanna be a mutant and stand up for mutant-rights	2
5183	The Nightmare Before Christmas	This film is art.  The visuals, the music, the story.  It is just an amazing film.	2
5184	Angels with Dirty Faces	enjoyed seeing the implications of the gangster in society; many movies have a tendency to tell the gangster's societal ramifications without showing. but the film grossly underused bogart, and skipping through most of the priest's campaign to bring down cagney's character was a questionable decision. still a solid work, especially the ending.	0
5185	Major Payne	a classic :)	2
5186	Deadpool	An good film made bad, by a low budget	2
5187	The Revenant	Some of the best camera work of any movie I've seen, especially during moments of action. Very fluid and immersive. Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.   Spectacular lighting. The story and characters lack complexity, but it excels in everything it tries to achieve. 	2
5188	Toy Story	Pixar's very first movie. Its animation completely changed how cartoon movies are made.	2
5189	Aliens	What makes this film so good is not just the great cast, sets and storyline, but also the spot-on pacing. For that reason it's best to avoid the directors cut and stick with the theatrical version.	2
5190	Raiders of the Lost Ark	One of the greatest movies of all time, and the start of my lifelong crush on Harrison Ford.	2
5191	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	There are those movies like Psycho who get better with age, and then there is this. Given its shocking content, it is perfectly understandable why the movie may have been somewhat influential at the time of its release. Nevertheless, had the film been released today, not only would it not stand out, it would epitomize everything that's wrong about the horror genre (awful acting, script and dialogues). In fact, these weaknesses made the movie hilarious at times, but for all the bad reasons.	0
5192	Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog	No, of course this movie isn't without flaw.  Can I think of any at the moment besides a grammatical error in one of the newspapers?  Nope.  The music is addicting.  Neil Patrick Harris is brilliant, very entertaining.  Actually, the entire cast is excellent.  I can't think of one moment in the film that I thought they could've changed or edited.  It is my choice musical and the first one I'll recommend if asked.  I can only wait patiently for a sequel which can't come soon enough.	2
5193	Playtime	Tati brings you exactly what you would expect bringing Mr. Hulot to a busy city. Every scene is framed like a work of art and every movement executed with ballet like precision. The man truly put his love into his films.	2
5194	Where the Wild Things Are	SO HARD to rate this movie. I am really conflicted. It's beautifully filmed and acted. The monsters were perfect. It was just missing something, but I don't know what. It was a bit dull at times and odd. Oh, and the music is wonderful, as well.	2
5195	Force Majeure	Sadece erkeklik-aile-ilişkiler üzerine bir film değil. Modernlik ve insan doğası üzerine etkileyici bir film. İnsanoğlu doğaya hükmedebileceğini sandı ancak atladığı kendi doğasıydı. -Her şey kontrol altında. (mı)?	1
5196	The Big Lebowski	Too slow, funny at times	0
5197	Orlando	Amazing book, horrible movie.	0
5198	The Girl Next Door	I think a lot of people missed the point here. Single handedly the most disturbing film I have ever seen. This because it is based on real events, which aren't that far removed. Is it the best example of filmmaking. No. Is it a reminder of the horrors that we enact upon each other? Yes. I can watch Hostel or any so-called Torture-Porn horror film over and over. This? I could never watch again. I put it half way between a film I could watch again and one that I regret ever watching at all.	0
5199	Akira	I really enjoy this movie.	2
5200	Angels with Dirty Faces	enjoyed seeing the implications of the gangster in society; many movies have a tendency to tell the gangster's societal ramifications without showing. but the film grossly underused bogart, and skipping through most of the priest's campaign to bring down cagney's character was a questionable decision. still a solid work, especially the ending.	0

5206	Murder on the Orient Express	If you watched Sherlock Holmes (2009), which is hard not to compare with, this one is less dramatic, less dark, less intense, less polished, and a bit less fluent. Do depending on your mood it can be better or worse. The strong point of the movie is that it's easy to watch, enjoyable, without being a stupid show movie.

  Gripping from start to the twist of a finish."	2
5209	All the Real Girls	my favorite movie about relationships by one of my favorite directors.  	2
5210	Hero	Great action film.  Beautiful cinematography of course, with an intriguing story interlaced with amazing action scenes.  A must see.	2
5211	This Is Spinal Tap	The most amazing docu-drama ever	2
5212	Inception	Another triumphant Nolan masterpiece, a testament to his ability to appeal to honest plebeians like ourselves and elitist movie critics. 	2
5213	Audition	The most harrowing last 30 minutes of a film I've ever witnessed.	1
5214	Pulp Fiction	A true masterpiece. I can watch this over and over again.	2
5215	Harold and Maude	My absolute all time favorite film! I cannot count the times I have seen it!	0
5216	8½	A peek inside the mind of The Creative Artist where memories, dreams, and experiences indulge in an orgy to produce a thing of beauty called imagination, which in turn ignites the creative process. A film which is an ode to the most potent agent of change in the world- The Creator's Mind. A Film which pushed me into the ocean of cinema and changed my life for good !	0
5217	American History X	This film is flawless in every way, from the cinematography to the acting, though the themes emphasised in the film truly make is stand out amongst all others.  Few films can evoke emotion in a way this does, in a way that sends chills down your spine and leaves you a changed person by the end.  	2
5218	The Godfather	It's like, the perfect movie.	2
5219	Batman Forever	Kiss from a Rose accounts for 90% of this score.	2
5220	The Long Day Closes	Rather than dabble in a straightforward narrative that would be easier to follow but occlude the things that really mattered, Terrence Davies films this story of his childhood in Malickian slice-of-life form. Sounds (like the titular song) and images (an overhead shot blending play, school, and religion) merge to form an impressionistic portrait that focuses on feelings rather than ideas. The result is one of the most powerful, honest, and sincere statements ever made in cinema.	2
5221	Gattaca	Great flick.	2
5222	Wreck-It Ralph	The first film with video game humor that wasn't a groan fest. Wreck It Ralph pulls you in with its in jokes but where the movie shines is oddly enough its original content it puts a spin on from original characters to originalish video games. An excellent job by Disney.	2
5223	Jaws	My all-time favourite 'creature' movie until KingKong came along to dethrone it! No CGI special-effects... no trickery... just pure 'creature' terror with great performances! The shark steals the show, though!	2
5224	The Fifth Element	this is up there with all time sci fi greats, Bruce Willis manages not to totally overact! the aliens are terrific and the fifth element herself is seriously kick ass,however the film does carry a message is is quite piongant at times. watch it for the the Diva Plana laguna scene,if only opera where this good!	2
5225	The Secret in Their Eyes	The stadium scene!!! I love it: A guy can change anything. His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion,his God. But there's one thing he can't change. He can't change his passion...	0
5226	Let the Right One In	So beautiful	2
5227	Million Dollar Baby	I never need to watch this movie again.	0
5228	Avatar	At first it was a great experience, however upon reflecting on the movie, problems arise and you start to get pissed. How did Cameron take 10 years to make such predictable recycled plot? Everywhere there's a cliche. James Cameron is lucky because some actors did a great job (mostly Zoe Saldana). However, it is a mediocre movie and most of the hype comes from marketing (you can't fool me twice, Cameron). After you wipe all the glitter from your eyes  it boils to a cash machine.	0
5229	Tropic Thunder	I wanted to like this, but it's just not that funny. The jokes are too far between, and not really that funny either. The action part is completely moronic and takes too much of the time.	0
5230	Kate & Leopold	Delightful. The characters are so perfectly defined. It's a shame Meg Ryan already had those un-enchating lips.	2
5231	Harold and Maude	love it!	2
5232	Fred Claus	nothing special.... however, very much positive film 	0
5233	The Martian	To me, it's the best movie of 2015. 	2
5234	Ice Age	I can never see a watermelon without quoting this movie. It contained some great metahistorical comments and the dialogues were witty, but the humour was mostly on the level of slapstick, which is a shame. Overall I liked it, but somehow it didn't always succeed in keeping me attentive. There's this little 'click' inside my head that's missing to make this a great movie.	1
5235	The Notebook	Not a fan of Ryan Goslings acting	0
5236	Lilo & Stitch	I love that they included Elvis Presley's songs, being a fan of his that made me really happy	2
5237	Orca: The Killer Whale	Very underrated. Sure it's a take off from Jaws two years earlier, but it's good in it's own right, worth a rental atleast.	2
5238	Turkish Star Wars	A catastrophic success !!!	2
5239	Deadpool	Great movie, just what I was expecting to see when watching Deadpool. Can't wait for Deadpool 2.	2
5240	Tropic Thunder	Hilarious movie if you are well aware of hollywood and film making, and of the movies being parodied, and especially if you know the actors. I imagine it might lose something if any of those conditions are not true for you.	2
5241	Over the Hedge	At least DreamWorks tried to make the characters look like their actors this time.  Still...no magic.	0
5242	Paul Blart: Mall Cop	If you view it as a spoof of Die Hard, its not god-awful. In fact, I kind of liked it, haha.	0
5243	Into the Wild	Both this kid and the film made about him are pretentious and self-absorbed.	0
5244	Mona Lisa	interesting, dark, innocet	2
5245	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Completes the story with awesome battle scenes and great acting.	2
5246	Jurassic Park	You have to admire it technically but there's not much else to admire.	1
5247	Hudson Hawk	Vastly underrated post-modern fun-fest. Yo.	2
5248	The English Patient	I really like sand	1
5249	Taken	I was looking really forward to this movie and i wasnt dissapointed when i got the time to watch it. It had some dubious dialogues but thats okay, cause Liam Neeson is really kicking it. Really enjoyed it.	2
5250	Dirty Dancing	Pretty much the worst movie I've ever seen.	0
5251	The Nightmare Before Christmas	I love this film. The music is catchy and will easily get stuck in your head; and the plot is amazing. It's a twisted sort of love story which also revolves around the kidnapping of Santa, known as Sandy Claws Highly recommended film.	2
5252	The Ring Two	Definitely not as good as the first. The plot isn't as interesting, or good, and it's not as scary.  	0
5253	The Dreamers	What the hell was that? Ugh!	0
5254	Juno	Honestly this is my all-time-favorite movie. Between the simplistic realism in the awkward interactions that many teens can relate to and the actor choice this is always the first movie I show my friends.	2
5255	The Grand Budapest Hotel	The Grand Budapest Hotel totally exceeded my expectations! The design aesthetic was awe-inspiring, with pretty pink pastels and meticulous dollhouse like proportions. The stop-motion animation teamed with the laugh out loud Ralph Fiennes, brings to fruition a colour co-ordinated picture book full of nostalgia. This movie is a creatives person dream, imagination come to life, both stylistically and performance wise!	2
5256	Fight Club	Amazing performance of Edward Norton, psychoanalytical 	2
5257	Gladiator	I soo fucking love this movie. The characters are awesome, the plot crush like a tornado of emotions and the action scenes are great. Finally, the phrase win the crowd and you'll win your freedom is amazing. By all means, Watch this movie!	2
5258	Triple 9	Reminded me of Pusher. Great action, raw, mysterious. Very physical. 	2
5259	The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel	Like a unique cross between Lost in Translation, Little Miss Sunshine, and Slumdog Millionaire. Though the movie is far from perfect, the characters are each fascinating to watch and the themes and emotions the movie evokes really touched a nerve in me. It hits on human-existentialism, finding meaning in life, love, changing ourselves and our environment, accepting others who are different than us, growing old, and losing people we care about. It also has a lot of funny moments. 	2
5260	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Perfect.	2
5261	Death Proof	Overly long, boring, and self indulgent	0
5262	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Probably my most favorite film of all time. Perfection. 	2
5263	Shaun of the Dead	Really good zombie movie, different than others in many ways. Be prepared to be surprised, this zombies are not the ones you know	2
5264	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Stupid movie for stupid people	0
5265	Napoleon Dynamite	Most overrrated movie EVER. The plot doesn't even seem to exist. Other than a few laughable lines or moments it's boring as they come. The climax comes and goes without you even knowing and then you get to the end and say, That's considered a movie? Don't buy the hype and waste your time.	0
5266	Hero	A masterpiece. Brilliant and beautiful. Visually stunning. Emotionally powerful. Action packed. Excellently choreographed. An epic retelling of a legendary piece of Chinese culture and history.	2
5267	The Revenant	my rating goes to bear attackt scene 	1
5268	Before Sunset	The rare sequel that actually improves upon the original. With a greater sense of urgency and a perfect ending, this one manages to build upon its predecessor and not only being better for it itself, but also enriching the first installment. One of the finest and smartest romance films of modern times.	2
5269	Trainspotting	Ew, gross.	0
5270	True Romance	I would say utterly jubilant	1
5271	Goodfellas	Hard-hitting and stylish, Goodfellas is a gangster classic - and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career.	2
5272	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	I remember watching this when I was younger. I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I'd like to revisit and watch this again soon.	2
5273	Summer Wars	A gem. You should have a smile on your face the entire time.  Hosoda's second film lives up to the first.	2
5274	Shaun of the Dead	A downright fun take on zombie movies. Enjoyable the whole way through with a hilarious cast. I've never cheered so much at the death of one character in a movie before.	2
5275	Flight of the Navigator	This film is more nostalgic for me than anything else! I always remember watching it as a child, and it never gives old. This was a very imaginative sci-fi film, especially for the family.	0
5276	Fight Club	I love this film and there's nothing anybody can tell me to change my mind. It's violent, shocking and could make the most mild-mannered person want to run up to somebody and punch them square in the face.	2
5277	The Godfather	the best movie of all time	2
5278	City of God	A great crime movie with spectacular writing and cinematography.	2
5279	Requiem for a Dream	Well made but such an over the top attempt at being emotionally manipulative with the worst possible case scenarios at the end (crazy grandma, one arm, ass2ass) that by the end the exploitation was just more comical to me than it was emotionally affecting. But Ellen Burstyn's performance did manage to get to me, though, and was a heart shattering portaryal. But I'm sensitive to old people. That's the only reason this score is so high.	2
5280	Cat People	A slow first half gives way to a masterclass in film suspense in the second half. 	0
5281	Harold and Maude	A classic!  	2
5282	Hero	beautiful!	2
5283	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	This movie is an absolute gem. As a loose adaptation of Odyssey starring a strangely well cast George Clooney and Jonh Turturruo, the movie entertains from beginning to end, with plenty of laughs and great music along the way.  John Goodman steals every scene he's in as the big talking Bible salesman Big Dan Teague	2
5284	The Way, Way Back	İzlemeyen birşey kaybetmez.	1
5285	Ace Ventura: Pet Detective	Jim Carrey's comedies have a certain something to them - they're good fun, but they don't stay fresh after a lot of viewings. Ace Ventura was kind of his breakout performance, and it was a decent showcase of his style. It may not go down in history as his best film, but it will go down as one of his most notable characters.	1
5286	Downsizing	Unnecessarily long 	1
5287	Before Sunset	How wonderful it is to see two characters we once loved re-unite after all these years. Hawke's Jesse and Delpy's Celine are two of the most well-drawn characters in recent cinema. Strong-headed, prickly, witty, and lonely these two characters remain both of these actors best work. Along with a beautiful, rolling screenplay and wonderful music composed by Delpy, this movie uses the same formula as its prequel Before Sunrise, only this time everyone is more seasoned, and therefore, better.	2
5288	Howard the Duck	The worst movie I've ever seen. Amazingly bad;	0
5289	Irreversible	This movie redefined what a good movie was for me. I had never looked so deeply into a film before. The cast, camera angles, lighting, plot, and total execution of Irreversible is amazing.	2
5290	American Psycho	Despite having a terrific premise - and a chillingly brilliant performance from Christian Bale - I felt the film essentially did nothing but establish a series of loose ends which it never tied up. As a character piece; and as an example of how queasy violence SHOULD be portrayed in film; this is a must-see. It's just a shame that the pay-out (or lack thereof) gave no hint of closure, which made the whole experience oddly unsatisfying when the credits rolled.	0
5291	Midnight in Paris	Love this movie.  Owen Wilson is great, the unfolding of the time changes is great, the interplay of historical figures is great, the scenery of Paris is great ( I accidentally stayed a few days near to one of the main locations).  Romantic, realistic view of love and hope and confusion  So Good. DramaFFlop rating:(see my profile for details)  Dialogue=5, Rudeness=5, Acting=4, Messages=3, Action=5, Funny=4, Filmography=5, Lovable Characters=4, Orchestration=4, Plot=5. WeightedScore =90	2

5293	Catwoman	Why can't you give negative points?  This was a two hour abortion with lots of pain.	0
5294	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	A great start to the Sequel trilogy. It looks & feels like a true Star Wars movie, and while it does borrow from the original it uses it to its advantage and it works well.	2
5295	Rescue Dawn	Capturing - in more than one meaning of the word	2
5296	Scrooged	Dear Bill Murray: please marry me.  Oh right, the movie.  This is one of my favorite adaptations of A Christmas Carol.  Bob Goldthwait does a good job of stealing every scene he's in.  When he and Bill are *both* on the screen, it's a thing of beauty.	2
5297	Baahubali: The Beginning	I just so thoroughly enjoyed this, objectivity went to hell.	2
5298	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow	It's all blurry...	1
5299	Predator	Probably one of my favorites, if not my favorite, Arnold Schwarzeneggar flick. 	2
5300	Juno	A very good film (and, indeed, soundtrack) that occasionally veers toward quirkyness for quirkyness's sake, but on balance pulls it off	2
5301	Inception	masterpiece	2
5302	Shrek 2	A fun followup.	2
5303	John Q	This time: a copy of Desperate Measures. Too predictible, too boring, with typical characters.	0
5304	wkw/tk/1996@7'55''hk.net	Chicago Bulls: Unstop-A-Bulls (NBA Basketball Documentary)	1
5305	Climax	Extraordinary craving, or necessity of living, unavoidably sails into extraordinary nightmare in collective impossibility of control. 	1
5306	Avatar	Gobsmacking technical wizardry transports viewers to an alien world of nature loving people. Humans are the villains here with their plundering ways. The story is just a co passenger in this journey of amazing technical show thats a must watch in 3d and in IMAX! This movie has set the bar in 3d. The 3d in this pic is surreal without any cliched approaches. Weak story however has a hard message. Nature is important don't plunder it.	2
5307	Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows	There was no reason to make this film. A few sequences and jokes were recycled from its predecessor and nothing new was added. 	0
5308	Signs	Good use of humor and quirky dialect but the movie lost big points with me when they actually showed the aliens.  Without the drama of not knowing what they were facing, the movie lost its edge.  Swing away was a bit predictable	1
5309	Sense8	I want to love this show so so so bad but the writing and dialogue is atrocious and I couldn't even finish the second season. All the elements for a good show are here and the setup is unique but the writing brings it down and it did not improve in the later seasons.	1
5310	Sense8	I want to love this show so so so bad but the writing and dialogue is atrocious and I couldn't even finish the second season. All the elements for a good show are here and the setup is unique but the writing brings it down and it did not improve in the later seasons.	1
5311	The Incredibles	The best animated movie ever?	2
5312	Shrek 2	A great sequel to the original Shrek. Continues the legacy and doesn't disappoint! Puss in boots is adorable!	2
5313	It's a Wonderful Life	I really really love this movie. Whenever I get sad, I watch this movie and be happy	2
5314	The Incredibles	Man I love this movie.	2
5315	House of Dracula		1
5316	Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels	WARNING: For people who have GOOD movie tastes, this movie may be the best ever made.	2
5317	Solo: A Star Wars Story	Yeah, it's unnecessary and the lighting can be awful sometimes, but I quite enjoyed the characters and thought the movie was quite enjoyable.	2
5318	Tideland	If you've ever seen Big Fish, shoot up lots of heroine and this will be the movie you see. It's screwed up to say the least. But as far as film making goes, pretty good. 	2
5319	Spider-Man 2	its a good movie and sam raimi did his best thing with spider - man projekt , so what you think :) ........	2
5320	Spider-Man 2	its a good movie and sam raimi did his best thing with spider - man projekt , so what you think :) ........	2
5321	Big Momma's House	he needs to quit	1
5322	Serenity	I have got sentiment for this film. The long awaited closure for Fire Fly series	1
5323	Gangs of New York	not scorseses best but impressive	2
5324	Taxi Driver	One of, if not, the greatest character study of all-time. DeNiro gives what may be his best performance in his eclectic filmography.	1
5325	Dead Snow	It is good that zombies get the victory at last. 	2
5326	Underworld: Rise of the Lycans	Great fun to watch some great actors doing some excellent scenery chewing, beyond that there's really nothing.	2
5327	Cul-de-sac	roman polanski'ye karşı önyargım vardı şimdilik bu önyargımı kırmadığı için kendisine teşekkürü borç bilirim.	1
5328	Harold and Maude	their friendship is beautiful. i want a montage of harold's performed suicide attempts.	2
5329	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	Stellar cast, and a script which is lean as whippet. The pace seems sedate at first, but every moment has importance as the story reveals itself. Looks amazing, superb atmospheric design. Gary Oldman is brilliant. His portrayal of Smiley is distinct from Sir Alec Guinness's famous master class in the TV version, and just as good. I wish they would do more films line this. 	2
5330	The Green Mile	One of the most beautiful films ever.	2
5331	Son of the Mask	Greatest film ever.	2
5332	Se7en	I actually really liked this film ... Freeman and Pitt had good chemistry.  Creepy. 	2
5333	Toy Story	Great animation movie by pixar that is perfect for any age. 	2
5334	Interstellar	An instant classic, loved every bit of it.	2
5335	Yes Man	I was alittle worried to see this movie because as a kid I always loved the Jim Carrey comedies and I felt that he might be washed up, but I was very surprised to find that it was actually good. I think one of the main reasons I loved this movie is because I love Zooey Deschanel.	2
5336	It Follows	It Follows the tone (naked old woman) and, at points, cinematography (the huge pool of blood) of Kubrick's The Shining, however its story lacks the depth necessary for the same character development and strong performances. Jay seems lifted from Mitchell's Myth of the American Sleepover which, in a movie underpinned by the establishment of an emotional connection with the protagonist, undermines the stakes. The result is a mediocre movie with a few good jump scares but ultimately unfulfilling.	0
5337	A Clockwork Orange	must see!:)	2
5338	Clerks II	A delightful return back to the View Askew universe.  Returning are the lovable characters Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob and just a few others, but adding to the mix is Rosario Dawson as the love interest to Dante, whom is getting married and leaving New Jersey and the rest of the gang.  Kevin Smith is a genius to return back to this humble town in New Jersey and put some closer on this universe, who knows if he will ever return back to it or not.	2
5339	Kingdom of Heaven	This movie is gold if you see the Director's cut (Between 3 to 4 hours in length). The theatrical edition is crap, but this is one case where the director's cut completely redeems the movie.	1
5340	The Big Lebowski	This movie is definitely bizarre, but there were a few scenes that absolutely cracked me up.  My husband and I still quote the Dude sometimes, years after we first saw it.	2
5341	Mad Max: Fury Road	amazing mad max movie where it shifts role to female protagonist	2
5342	Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky	A amazing martial art's movie with some of the best and craziest fights ever	2
5343	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Gotta see it for Johnny Depp's pirate character. Hilarious. 	2
5344	Batman	really bad... but in a very charming way	2
5345	The Matrix	Very very nice movie of sci-fi!	2
5346	The Day After Tomorrow	I know I shouldn't like this movie, but I did to some extent.	1
5347	Gladiator	This movie teachs if you are right god will gives you chance to prove yourself.	2
5348	Scream	As far as great horror movies go, Scream is without a doubt near the very top of the list. It's obvious self-awareness never overshadows it's scares and that's a balance that most horror films these days cannot achieve. Add in some expertly developed main characters and a clever script from Kevin Williamson, and you have yourself a great horror film. I just wish the sequels could live up to this one. 	2
5349	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Great adventue	2
5350	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Simply the best Jack Nicholson's performance, if you ask me. I've watched this more than a couple times already and never did it disappoint me. From beginning to end it would keep you from guessing and anticipating the character's next move.	1
5351	Unbreakable	usually i hate it when people try and make the super hero genre all mature and boring. but this movie is a weep fest. man-tears will flow.	2
5352	The Big Lebowski	This movie is definitely bizarre, but there were a few scenes that absolutely cracked me up.  My husband and I still quote the Dude sometimes, years after we first saw it.	2
5353	Mad Max: Fury Road	amazing mad max movie where it shifts role to female protagonist	2
5354	The Matrix	Best, ever.	2
5355	End of Watch	If you take out all of the F words you would have two minutes of dialogue. Good movie though! 	0
5356	The Green Mile	One of the most beautiful films ever.	2
5357	Son of the Mask	Greatest film ever.	2

5366	The Purge: Election Year	horrible acting from most of the actors. i felt no sympathy for the characters and found this film overall a complete disaster. 	0
5367	The Matrix Reloaded	excelent	1
5368	Shaun of the Dead	I laughed all the way through.	2
5369	Akira	One of my first experiences with anime films.  Still one of my top suggestions for people wanting to know about anime.	2
5370	Moana	I like the fact that it's not about a prince but I was not entertained.	0
5371	Open Range	Open Range-with Robert Duvall,   Excellent	2
5372	Watchmen	Cut from a different cloth then your typical superhero movie, this cloth being of much higher quality.	0
5373	Ex Machina	84.50+.50 = 85.00.	1
5374	The Hateful Eight	Never thought I would enjoy a horror western this much. Yes a horror western.	1
5375	The Sound of Music	The all time classic of musicals.	2
5376	Bohemian Rhapsody	It was not a detailed movie, just Hollywood classic but even so like it	2
5377	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Loved this movie from beginning to end  this was back when George Lucas was at his prime.	2
5378	The Birds	Classic Hitchcock! A good movie full of suspense and drama.	2
5379	Mulholland Drive	A great movie with loads of symbolic allusions. I watched it three times until i had a clue of the big picture. The first watch is a worthwhile experience too because of the dense and somehow mystical atmosphere.	2
5380	The Matrix	Innovative.  It really brought about a new possibility of reality.  Although the 2 movies that followed were not very good, this was a blockbuster that few can contend with.	2
5381	Akira	"Let me start by saying that the animation is absolutely wonderful.  A Glorious 27 hand-painted frames per second.  While the material can get rather gruesome at times, it's nothing that bothers me.  The music adds a lot of weight to the scenes, and is full of all the crazed chanting and gamelan-banging you could ever want.

Overall, I love it."	2
5382	A Prophet	a masterpiece of audiard ! 	2
5383	My Neighbor Totoro	difficult to rate a miyazaki movie. The peacefulness and overall feeling when watching totoro is what gets me all the time	0
5384	The Matrix Reloaded	great movie overall	2
5385	Fantastic Planet	Amazingly trippy. Good eye candy, confusing story.	2
5386	Juno	Funny and heartwarming, this is the movie that made me an Ellen Page fan, its a little preachy at parts but other than that one of my favorite films.	2
5387	The Girl Who Leapt Through Time	nice movie	2
5388	Four Lions	good old fashion tabu fun	2
5389	Dark City	Great movie, cool story.	2
5390	Mulholland Drive	Flawless -- except that it's so sad.	2
5391	True Romance	This movie is an good example that everyone has own style of love.  	2
5392	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	damn.	1
5393	The Diary of Anne Frank	Deluded. I didn't expect her to die :'( 	1
5394	Brick	"Amazing. Took me by surprise and blew me away. One of the best 
crimi/noir/thrillers and it's placed in a... highschool. :) how about that. Awesome performances, esp. by Levitt. "	2
5395	The Fountain	The Fountain is about 3 paralleling stories, each in a different time period and setting.  This movie has wonderful acting, a good script, and an exquisite story.  I absolutely loved this movie and it left me in heart felt tears.  	2
5396	It	Verrry Scary!!	1
5397	Pan's Labyrinth	Wonderful movie that rekindled my love for international films.  A great movie that creeps into the dark side and takes you on a journey.	2
5398	The Call	I loved it. everyone mainly berry and breslin were perfect. 	2
5399	Fantastic Mr. Fox	Wes Anderson always makes things interesting. The voices were great, and I really enjoyed how the movie was made (doll characters). I got a little bored with it and think it could have been better.	2
5400	Primer	Watch it twice! If you enjoy this, I'd also recommend Pi (1998), Timecrimes (2007), and The Man from Earth (2007).	2
5401	The Invention of Lying	No fun at all	0
5402	This Is Spinal Tap	he exploded on stage :) 	1
5403	Serenity	Great Movie, ultimate recommendation to all Sci Fi Fans, but watch firefly first as this spoils many mysteries in the series. All in all great film.	2
5404	Shaun of the Dead	I am huge fan of Zombie movies and shows and this was by far the best comedic zombie movie I have seen. In my opinion Simon Pegg hit another one out of the park. 	1
5405	Back to the Future	I know it seems like I must give 100 to every movie but this and the previous happen to be two of my very favourites. Marty and the Doc are great, complex and interesting characters, the writing is superb and the sci-fi/comedy mix is what sells it for me. Some of the lines in the movie are just unforgettable and the plot, while complex at first, is fun and exciting. Watch it! 	2
5406	Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery	very funny but doesnt have any point to the movie	1
5407	Troll 2	One of the most quotable movies of all time. Perfect example of how fun a bad movie can be.	2
5408	The Passion of the Christ	It's not the kind of movie you sit down and enjoy...  but stayed pretty true to what actually happened.	1
5409	The Mist	Very good movie.  Glad I watched it once, but thanks to the ending I will never watch it again.  The ending was good, just hard to watch once and not something I feel like I want to watch again.  I give the director huge kudos for being willing to use the ending he did - most directors would have gone for a more Hollywood ending.	2
5410	Glengarry Glen Ross	great 	2
5411	The Cat in the Hat	Shitty.	1
5412	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	Virgem.	1
5413	Jurassic Park	Without a doubt, one of the best. My favorite as a kid.	2
5414	Four Lions	One of the bleakest, most human black comedies I've seen. Morris puts a daringly sympathetic face on the hapless suicide bombers while simultaneously condemning the pressures and motives driving them toward terrorist acts. By the end I felt like I'd been sucker punched by a clown--I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh or cry.	1
5415	Unbreakable	usually i hate it when people try and make the super hero genre all mature and boring. but this movie is a weep fest. man-tears will flow.	2

5419	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Gotta see it for Johnny Depp's pirate character. Hilarious. 	2
5420	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Good futuristic approach, slightly scary.	2
5421	Primer	Watch it twice! If you enjoy this, I'd also recommend Pi (1998), Timecrimes (2007), and The Man from Earth (2007).	2

5429	Open Range	Open Range-with Robert Duvall,   Excellent	2
5430	Layer Cake	A superb tale with interesting characters. This thriller has fullfills though i think it is 20 minutes too long. One of the best British gangster films ever.	2
5431	Donnie Darko	Amazing indy film.  Think of it as a more dark, twisted American Beauty.  And if it wasn't good enough, it throws in Mad World by Gary Jules as the closing musical track.....amazing.  	2
5432	Taxi Driver	One of, if not, the greatest character study of all-time. DeNiro gives what may be his best performance in his eclectic filmography.	1
5433	Dead Snow	It is good that zombies get the victory at last. 	2
5434	Underworld: Rise of the Lycans	Great fun to watch some great actors doing some excellent scenery chewing, beyond that there's really nothing.	2
5435	Cul-de-sac	roman polanski'ye karşı önyargım vardı şimdilik bu önyargımı kırmadığı için kendisine teşekkürü borç bilirim.	1
5436	Harold and Maude	their friendship is beautiful. i want a montage of harold's performed suicide attempts.	2
5437	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	Stellar cast, and a script which is lean as whippet. The pace seems sedate at first, but every moment has importance as the story reveals itself. Looks amazing, superb atmospheric design. Gary Oldman is brilliant. His portrayal of Smiley is distinct from Sir Alec Guinness's famous master class in the TV version, and just as good.

5447	A Clockwork Orange	must see!:)	2
5448	Clerks II	A delightful return back to the View Askew universe.  Returning are the lovable characters Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob and just a few others, but adding to the mix is Rosario Dawson as the love interest to Dante, whom is getting married and leaving New Jersey and the rest of the gang.

5459	The Theory of Everything	this movie and stephen hawking's life are unbelievable. i didn't know Stephen Hawking before i watched it but now i am totally impressed about his intelligence, his resolution, all of his life. i should say that Eddie Redmayne is an amazing actor. this is the best acting of the human who has disease, ı've seen. everyone should watch it.	0

5476	Logan	Top 100  no:96	0
5477	The Thaw	Extremely stupid movie but an interesting concept that is actually based on reality, just too bad it's completely destroyed by a typical horrible hollywood horror movie script, actors, story, moronic actions etc, but people who hate the movie because of the so-called political propaganda are if possible even dumber than the characters in this movie.	0
5478	Brick	Amazing movie! I love it!!!	2
5479	Yesterday	Awesome movie. Funny, yet without the normal stupid Hollywood standard parts. Well, almost. But good enough!	2
5480	Pulp Fiction	As films go this is sheer class and should be on everybodies must watch list, provided you enjoy a bit of violence and don't mind a bit of bad lanuage. 	2
5481	Alien: Covenant	Stupid people do stupid decisions and die stupidly. I gave it 35 score only for the following: 1. It's in my favorite franchise - I think there is no better horror idea that Alien Xenomorph by Giger. And Alien is present, even not in final form. 2. Android is great, even with all this gay shit. 3. Idea about humans&gods&robots&creators/etc. That's all folks. I hope next movie won't be such a B-movie. 	2
5482	Fight Club	this is a great movie! had to turn away alot from pain...	2
5483	Swiss Army Man	Loses its edge instantly. Feels like it was written stream-of-consciousness by an angsty teenage boy. 	0
5484	The Big Lebowski	Dude!	1
5485	Ghost Town	Liked it! Don't expect anything drama or very keen humour and the ending is a bit too much morality, but still. Good sunday afternoon fun.	2
5486	Suicide Squad	I watch this movie twice in cinema, even though im a big fan of Batman and it changes since Affleck but i must say Suicide Squad is like what most article said. It wasn't as good as what you expected but wasn't as bad as what you hear. 	2
5487	Braveheart	funny (not intentionally), historically wrong, 	1
5488	The Wolf of Wall Street	This is my favorite movie ever	2
5489	Hell	Very, very lame.	0
5490	Midnight in Paris	One of Allen's best later films, although you may have to be an English major to enjoy it.  Classic Allen, a bit goofy, a bit philosophical.  Nothing great, but not a waste of time either.	2
5491	The Farewell	nice versus between east culture and west	2
5492	Infernal Affairs	It's rare to find a remake that's better than the original, but THE DEPARTED blows this Hong Kong gang-flick out of the water in every way imaginable. Worth watching only to compare to Scorsese's adaptation.	2
5493	Toy Story	One of the first animated films I remember watching, during a phase where I'd watch movies over and over again ad nauseam. The Toy Story series holds a special place in my soul, Pixar's best series in my opinion. 	2
5494	My Blueberry Nights	stylisticly perfect yet slightly disappointing	2
5495	Let the Right One In	A vampire film unlike any other.  Heartfelt, disturbing and VERY well written.  My fantasy is for movie fans to skip Twilight and watch Let the Right One in.  This is the type of film that stays with you long after the credits start rolling.	2
5496	Pulp Fiction	I think my favourite thing about this was the dialogue. A fun story that somehow also makes you think. All-around very enjoyable.	2
5497	Winter's Bone	Beautifully acted and directed this film sucks you in in an instant and does not let go and has the ability to make the fact you are watching fiction dissolve. These were real people to me and that is what makes this so emotional as well as engrossing. One of the years best but then you already know that.	0
5498	The Big Lebowski	Probably the best film of 1998. A perfect metaphor for what a smart working class person goes through trying to make his way in a town full of the rich, ambitious, dumb, and insane.	2
5499	Pet Sematary	Zelda was the cause of many a sleepless night for me as a kid. Still the scariest film character I can think of.	2
5500	Inglourious Basterds	"For Brad Pitt's accent when speaking italian, and great actor Christopher Waltz that's a bingo.
I'm French and I think French actors in the movie were bad."	1
5501	Eros	Kar Wai Wong's part is the best. what a shakespearean way to tell the love and sexuality with a dress	2
5502	Green Book	Well crafted movie. Funny in places, poignant in places. Viggo's best acting. Awesome performance by Mahershala Ali. 	2
5503	Drive	Pacing issues with no actual character development. While the soundtrack is good, this can't carry the movie. Its just a rip off of Clint Eastwood's character with nothing new to add.	0
5504	Mission: Impossible	This movie makes no sense, but I still love it.	2
5505	Back to the Future	One of my mot favorite films of all time. 	2
5506	Reign Over Me	A movie about unspeakable loss. It tackles a Huge Issue (9-11 tragedy) in the best way: by taking a sharp focus on a single family and never mentioning the Huge Issue by name. By going so deep and convincingly into a specific story, the film works as an allegory and as an incredibly moving tale in its own right. Even though it is crushingly sad, it won't leave you depressed. Every actor is in top form. Bonus: This movie allows one to say seriously: Adam Sandler deserved the Best Actor Oscar	2
5507	Lost in Translation	The second most overrated film of the decade, after The Departed.	1
5508	The Fountain	Darren Aronofsky may be one of today's most underestimated directors, but this much is true...the man can cultivate an image and evoke emotion.  I thought this movie was amazing, both visually and, in scope and story.  Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are wonderful.	2
5509	Hulk	Holy crap this was boring.	0
5510	Crash	one of the best movies i have ever seen 	2
5511	12 Years a Slave	best of the best	2
5512	The Matrix	The best movie I saw in my entire life.	2
5513	The Mission	brillian music of Enio Morricone	1
5514	Martyrs	This was really good, but I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone.	2
5515	3 Extremes	very unusual, very weird, very interesting	2
5516	Ay Büyürken Uyuyamam	This unintentional comedy is a must-see, because it's so inexplicably bad.	0
5517	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	So much worse than the Gene Wilder version.	0
5518	Eastern Promises	Surprisingly great movie. I haven't seen any Cronenberg prior to this and I was really caught off guard by how well made it was. I always found my self deeply involved in every scene and felt really satisfied as the movie ended.	2
5519	The Big Lebowski	awesome. walters a da!!	2
5520	The Fifth Element	I consider The Fifth Element to be my favorite film. At times you can tell Luc Besson wrote some of the screen play when he was in his early teens, but overall an excellent movie. 	2
5521	A Charlie Brown Christmas	You just can't go wrong with Charlie Brown and the Gang.	2
5522	Old Yeller	i always wanted to hit the younger brother in the film.	1
5523	Jersey Shore Shark Attack	It's the best thing Syfy film ever, but the CGI is terrible and it's still hilariously bad.	2
5524	Batman Begins	A very good movie, making Batman a darker character and a darker series than most comic book movies.  It's a great, suspenseful movie.	2
5525	D@bbe	best turkish horror ever made!	2
5526	The Matrix	Awesome action packed movie. Very futuristic and makes you think.	2
5527	Happy Feet	too much propoganda	0
5528	Le Ballon rouge	I was bored to death already after first 30 seconds and after that it just become worst.	0
5529	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	pretentious shock shlock, no value. 	0
5530	Yesterday	Awesome movie. Funny, yet without the normal stupid Hollywood standard parts. Well, almost. But good enough!	2
5531	Ford v Ferrari	The racing sequences are great, but its really the lead-up to the climactic race that does the heavy lifting. The race is almost an afterthought, with the real conflict of the film being not between Ford and Ferrari, but between Ford and the race team the company's assembling. The film is ultimately about drawing the distinction between the art of racing ( a body moving through space a time) and the machinations of industry that undergird that experience's existence.	1
5532	South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut	The best comedy and/or musical ever made. Almost hands-down.	2
5533	Primer	Though I always enjoy a good time-travel flick, I enjoyed this movie more for the revolutionary writing that I hope inspires future filmmakers. This film made me feel like I was watching the result of a sudoku puzzle being ran through a movie projector. It makes the viewer itch for complete understanding and capitalizes on rewatchability.	2
5534	We Own the Night	Bunch of stereotypes thrown together to create a cliché plot with very cliché characters.	0
5535	Jaws	The father of the modern summer blockbuster.	2
5536	Starship Troopers	I don't do comments as you can tell, BUT. I have to say this is probabaly one of the more hated movie among my peers. Too bad. What you don't see is that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Think not? Ever see an Ed Wood movie? Crap....,but cult crap held in high regard and looked to as an inspiration. This is the movie Ed Wood or Robert Lippert would have made if they had the technology and the money. If you watch those 50's sci-fi B movies over and over you know where this came fr	0
5537	Trainspotting	great second film.  too bad danny boyle bust his nut with this movie.  everything else he's made is rubbish.	0
5538	True Romance	My favorite least known movie. Since I heard of this movie from my movie friend Adam, I have preached the greatness of this movie like it was a religion. Hero arc, soundtrack, great actors, great dialogue, and great camera/lighting...nothing not to like. Bloody and violent but if you would enjoy this movie enjoy it fully and watch the unrated version which has one of the most pivotal but violent scenes that I think is necessary	2
5539	Don Jon	It's very funny and I'll give it that; there are several sight gags that made me laugh every single time they came up. And it's clever in most of its execution, but something about it didn't quite work for me. The last 20-30 minutes just struck me as having come more-or-less without any of the character moments to sell it. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure I liked it. 	0
5540	Resident Evil: Extinction	I liked this. I suppose i'm in the minority.	2
5541	Dark City	I enjoyed the noir aesthetic of the city scenes and found the concept behind it interesting, however, I could not enjoy the film due to the way in which both the concept and the important plot twist are dealt with so briefly (the concept does not seem to be dealt with at all, really). This, the ridiculous nature of the villains, which made me feel pained whenever they were on the screen, and the dodgy, tacky aesthetic of The Strangers' world sadly made it impossible for me to enjoy this film.	0
5542	Possessions	This beautiful and mysterious Oscar nominee (Best Animated Short Film) is reminiscent of Miyazaki, but still proves to be surprising and original.	2
5543	Shoplifters	23.01.2019 // Kadıköy Sineması	1
5544	Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan	Torture	0
5545	Bana Masal Anlatma	@Beyoğlu Fitaş	1
5546	Pan's Labyrinth	Magical story, great actors, and the visual effect's are absolutely superb.	2
5547	The Silence of the Lambs	Dick tuck 	1
5548	The Apple	Incredibly terrible.	0
5549	Hulk	Ang Lee only failure to date.	0
5550	City of God	Great! Just great !	2
5551	Baraka	More than a movie	1
5552	Un Cuento de Amor, Locura y Muerte	expresive minimal Short Film about hard and complicated situation	0
5553	Mad Max: Fury Road	Maybe I don't understand it, or simply I cannot appreciate its beauty. Without a firm story, its spectacular special effects are the sole enjoyment in this road movie, that seems superficial and pointless. 	0
5554	Midnight in Paris	A bit dull. Sophomoric.	0
5555	Inception	Fantástico! Christopher Nolan consegue mais uma vez, no entanto aqui a diferença é que ele criou a história, fez o roteiro, e ainda dirigiu essa obra prima. Envolvente mistura muito do que eu gosto: ação, uma boa história, conspiração, tensão... Aqui pra mim está a melhor seqüência do cinema que não se ve há muito tempo: van caindo + sonhos, e sim, tudo faz sentido! Incrivél, so não do 100 porque nunca se sabe se pode haver algum filme melhor. Marion Cotillard e Leonardo diCaprio rouban a ce	0
5556	Enchanted	It's a Disney picture ment to engage children? OK. But the film is able to envolve anyone who has ever heard a fairytale. Amy Adams acting as the clueless princess waiting for the prince charming is amazing - and even sarcastic at times... Oh, and there are the songs (oh, please, don't sing begs the guy - I surrended to the film right there...), but even them are acceptable: give the girl a break - not only does she have to find her real love, but also to clean the house and get a job...	2
5557	The Kids Are All Right	story about a family consisting of two maternal figures (lesbian couple), and two teenage children, both the offspring of the same sperm donor. The movie focuses on the family's attempt to incorporate said sperm donor, played by Mark Ruffalo, into their lives, and of course this complicates the family dynamic leading to an array of consequences that range from light hearted comedy to genuine tragedy and back again. It's by no means a particularly ground breaking film but it's competent. Good.	2
5558	Twilight	ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. And Yes, I will proudly admit to being a twi-hard fan having read all 4 of the books more than once =) Can't wait for the others to be filmed 	2
5559	Fight Club	Probably Fincher's best, fantastic film. 	2
5560	District 9	unpopular players made this film great.	1
5561	Grizzly Man	Sorry, I have a dark sense of humor, and while I understand the grim reality of the ending, I can't help but find this one of the most unintentionally funny movies ever.	0
5562	Starry Eyes	God, how fucking stupid and pointless this movie was.	0
5563	The Hurt Locker	boring but excellent !	2
5564	Legion	Did somebody mistype this as horror/action? Because I'm pretty certain this was the funniest movie of 2010. Too many great lines to quote like Tyrese explaining the old woman climbinb on the ceiling with baby teeth. Classic. I give it a 1 for the talent it took the people who made this film to lie to someone enough to give them the chance to make this horrendous movie.	2
5565	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Would have gotten a higher score if it wasn't for Keira Knightly.	0
5566	The Birds	outstanding!	2
5567	Serenity	Unorthodox and amazing movie that introduced me to the greatest sci-fi tv series ever - Firefly (albeit a little late like most Firefly fans).	2
5568	Lawrence of Arabia	One of the very best films of all time.  Brilliant acting, directing and cinematography.  The genius combination of Peter O'Toole and David Lean can't be beat.  A must see film for everyone.	2
5569	The Air I Breathe	If you really wish Hollywood did better movies, than this movie is really it. 	0
5570	Electrocuting an Elephant	viral marketing was a young art at the time	1
5571	Se7en	One of the intensed thrillers iv seen.	1
5572	The China Syndrome	a solid thriller throughout, but the final scene is simply brilliant.	2
5573	The Blues Brothers	Look i know its supposed to be a classic, but this movie is way too long i only scored it as high as i did, because of a few scenes and the writing (which was stellar) the movie itself just seems to drag.	0
5574	The Bourne Identity	"Does not do justice to the book.

The last thing I want to see is Marie St. Joseph's with a different name and a different characterization. I am sure there must have been a better way of making the film.

That said, the film is fast and pacy, if you see it without reading the book first."	0
5575	The Sixth Sense	Master-piece from Shyamalan	2
5576	Last Vegas	This felt like Hangover:geriatric edition. Sad for the most part, embarrasing for the rest.	0
5577	Lost in Translation	One of my all time favorite movies. So beautiful and funny at the same time. Bill Murray was amazing.	2
5578	The Purge: Election Year	sure	1
5579	Taking Chance	We are the americans ... who is more ....  just missing flying american flag and anthem in the background at the end 	0
5580	The Mirror	This is simply the greatest cinematic achievement in film history to me.	2
5581	Grave of the Fireflies	Careful. If you have a heart, this movie will tear it out of you and then put it through a meat grinder.	1
5582	Inception	There are some mistakes, but that's a good movie.	2
5583	Pacific Rim	Popcorn movie that served as brilliant mind-numbing entertainment. worked for me! 	2
5584	This Is Spinal Tap	This film was made for me.	1
5585	Notting Hill	The movie was good enough, but I really just don't like Hugh Grant. I sw this because I do like Julia Roberts, but HG ruined it for me.	0
5586	I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry	Eh.  This is one of those movies you see late night when you have nothing else to do and you stumbled onto it.  Some parts are entertaining enough to almost prevent it from being a waste of time...but that doesn't really make it worthwhile now does it?	2
5587	Parental Guidance	wow, just look at that film cover, makes In Time look like a masterpiece	2
5588	Boxing Helena	and then the little boy woke up in the morning and discovered it was only a dream... a dream... a dream...	1
5589	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	60	1
5590	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	A masterpiece of art-direction, cinematography, casting and storytelling. Often overlooked in any discussion of the best film in the trilogy because of RotK, I'd put it right at the top. In fact so far it is the only film I've seen to be given the perfect 100. 	2
5591	Alien	An almost perfect movie. Great villain, great mystery, masterfully executed.	2
5592	Fast Five	A guilty pleasure involving explosions, heists, car chases, and a surprising amount of character payoff. The only real problem I have is the fight between Rock and Diesel. Buuuuuuullllllshhhhhiiiiiiiit.	2
5593	Noah	By far the worst Aronofsky/Mansell Collaboration.  Plot was not great but it was partially redeemed by some scenes with gorgeous visuals (The creation story comes to mind.	2
5594	Wendy and Lucy	A modern day Umberto D that works very well and is driven by a wonderful performance from Michelle Williams. 	2
5595	Mad Max: Fury Road	I really don't see what's good in this movie, besides the fact that it actually makes fun of serious action movies with its '80s tone and ridiculous characters. The figure of Max is rendered completely useless, while the whole story is just lame. The best thing are the thugs, lots of fun	1
5596	He Was a Quiet Man	Despite it's multiple flaws, He Was a Quiet Man is a great flick. The plot twist was completely unexpected.	2
5597	The Prestige	Best movie ever	2
5598	We Are the Best!	a little sheltered for punks, eh?	0
5599	The Matrix	i love films like this	2
5600	Alone in the Wilderness	A fascinating look into a life that some people dream about but never go through with. Dick Proenneke is a about as authentic as they come and documents his life and work in incredible detail.	2
5601	A Good Year	the film itself is predictable but entertaining. It's the setting and cinematography that make this film worth seeing.	2
5602	Werckmeister Harmonies	The real essence of Cinema for me.	1
5603	Hachiko: A Dog's Story	Probably the saddest movie I've ever seen... If you don't cry while watching this movie, you're not human... 	0
5604	13 Tzameti	Sick!	0
5605	Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels	Damn good movie, love it, want to see more of this sort movies!	2
5606	Memento	..And then out of the blue comes ''Memento''.. A brilliant and strange idea that turns into a movie and blows your mind away. An absolute ''Must See''.	2
5607	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles	This one takes me back to being a kid... so I love it still.	2
5608	Ugetsu	Les contes de la lune vague entend décrire la totalité cosmique du monde. Le fond du coeur de l'homme, les mystères du ciel, le visible et l'invisible sont leur sujet, et il est sans limites.	1
5609	Czech Dream	While their experiment could have been executed better... I think it's a good look into the consumerist mentality that has infected not only the U.S., but the world as well 	1
5610	Seven Samurai	Wonderful film. I absolutely love it	2
5611	Braveheart	An epic tale of oppression and the fight for freedom.  THe battle scenes are top of the line and the drama is very well done.	2
5612	Stalker	An unrivalled cinematic experience. Illusory, emotional, beautiful - just everything you could ask for.	2
5613	Taxi Driver	I love this film for its somber mood and sharp social commentary. Great acting and directing.	2
5614	The Ring Thing	worst movie ever	0
5615	Mulholland Drive	Another haunting, surreal masterpiece by auteur David Lynch, arguably his best, a film that does what few films do, an incredible piece of art that no other art form could come close to emulating not the feelings, ideas nor atmospheres that Mulholland Dr. does. An experience.	1
5616	Russian Ark	a perfect poem.	2
5617	Slither	Great cheesy 80s-style grossout flick. Manages to be both unique and original despite being cobbled together from bits and pieces of what must be a dozen different older movies.	2
5618	Falling Down	Brilliant.	2
5619	The Godfather	I mean, this is the essential American narrative, right? Is there any reason to go into detail about why The Godfather is perfect?	0
5620	41	Australian movies have always had a budget limiting them, yet forcefully pushed for different ways of writing.  A whole different concept of movie making happens. Not until the end does the full impact of this lovely concept hit home. 	2
5621	Chandni Chowk to China	Its a shame that this movie has the Warner Bros. stamp. Furthermore got an good action director and budget and what the director makes is 150mins of buffoonery. It has a worst possible start, absolutely rubbish. Even later in the better action scenes the director has this incorrigible itch to include stupid jokes and music that totally takes away the punch. With such bad direction, its no point commenting on acting. Story...well it blends 100s of old/new story lines to make this pathetic movie.	0
5622	Mulholland Drive	my favorite.	2
5623	Three Monkeys	An example of how a weak story with cliched scenarios can be uplifted to great heights with mastery in craftsmanship.	0
5624	No Country for Old Men	the most unconventional addition to the thriller genre since film noir. Silent, brutal and surprising, like the two antagonists, this movie has no respect for action-, drama- or thriller-genre-specific standards, and thus keeps you engaged despite its slow speed and long runtime.	2
5625	Seraphim Falls	What starts off as a suspenseful thriller set in the post Civil War western US, ends up a philosophical head scratcher.  The unexpected turn isn't terrible, but it probably would have worked better if it had followed through on its original path.  However, I applaud the effort to stretch beyond its boundaries.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as it should have.	0
5626	Interstellar	MUUUUURF	1
5627	The Protector	gökhan tiryakinin hatrına 10. senaryo ve oyunculuk berbattı. diyaloglardan bahsetmicem zaten Türk sineması sessiz sinemaya dönse fena olmaz.	1
5628	This Is the End	Garbage. Pretends to be self-deprecating, but is actually rather smug and self-indulgent with its relentless mockery of religion and inside jokes. (Christians are real idiots, get it? Michael Cera is actually a nice guy! Get it?) Wow. This movie is just NOT funny and was painful to watch. The saddest part is the writers thought they were being clever when in reality the film was so dumb and self-obsessed it missed its own point. How's that for irony, Rogen? I'm embarrassed for everyone involved.	0
5629	Us	Hitchcock karşılaştırmaları vs. bu film için cidden komik. Hitchcock'un filmlerinin neredeyse tamamı, özünde aşk temalıdır, bu bambaşka bir şey. Slasher türüne de oldukça yakın ve olsa olsa John Carpenter, G. A. Romero veya erken dönem Sam Raimi sinemasıyla karşılaştırılabilir. Kör parmağım gözüne kısımları yok sayarsak, yer yer oldukça iyi, geren ve eğlenceli bir film olmuş. Get Out'tan daha iyi bir film. 	0
5630	The Strangers	Contrary to some other people in this forum, what I particularly liked about this movie was that the killers had no reason whatsoever for what they were doing, they just were pure evil. If you want motifs, go and see some psychological drama, I prefer horrors.	0
5631	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	very good one	2
5632	August: Osage County	i can't believe that i have never said that but juia roberts is better than meryl the great streep	1
5633	Watchmen	This was much more than a comic book super hero movie. 	1
5634	Nuit noire	A brilliant, visually stunning film. Lots to think about. A little kafka-esque.	2
5635	The Stoning of Soraya M.	very orientalist, very hollywood unfortunately, far from being an Iran cinema...	0
5636	L.I.E.	There is nothing disturbing about this. Actings and characters are just terrible.	0
5637	The Hangover	Funny, but the funniest part was the credits	2
5638	Celeste and Jesse Forever	Not a laugh-a-minute comedy, but I was surprised how many times I laughed out loud. Good performances, enjoyable plot and comedy, look forward to more of Rashida Jones' and Will McCormack's scripts.	2
5639	Un Chien Andalou	it's very interesting movie. It's totally absurd but there is a story behind it! I didn't understand everything but understood something true about the movie by reading the story.	2
5640	The Matrix	Best sci-fi movie ever!	2
5641	No Country for Old Men	This film has great personal significance for me.  Though when I first saw it in the theatres, I found it very straightforward and simple, it was still stunning and thrilling (Javier Bardem's character was terrifying and fascinating).  A great storyline, a great neo-western, outstanding cinematography, a perfect ending (though many people wanted to good guy to win and the bad guy to lose, it ended up being a bit more complex than that).  Bravo, etcetera, etcetera.	2

5652	The Thaw	Extremely stupid movie but an interesting concept that is actually based on reality, just too bad it's completely destroyed by a typical horrible hollywood horror movie script, actors, story, moronic actions etc, but people who hate the movie because of the so-called political propaganda are if possible even dumber than the characters in this movie.	0
5653	Brick	Amazing movie! I love it!!!	2
5654	Yesterday	Awesome movie. Funny, yet without the normal stupid Hollywood standard parts. Well, almost. But good enough!	2
5655	Ford v Ferrari	The racing sequences are great, but its really the lead-up to the climactic race that does the heavy lifting. The race is almost an afterthought, with the real conflict of the film being not between Ford and Ferrari, but between Ford and the race team the company's assembling. The film is ultimately about drawing the distinction between the art of racing ( a body moving through space a time) and the machinations of industry that undergird that experience's existence.	1
5656	South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut	The best comedy and/or musical ever made. Almost hands-down.	2
5657	Primer	Though I always enjoy a good time-travel flick, I enjoyed this movie more for the revolutionary writing that I hope inspires future filmmakers.

5661	The Prestige	Excellent movie, it will definitely put your brain to work.	2
5662	The Net	I don't think the makers of this movie actually know anything about the internet. It was painful to watch but difficult to turn away from; in other words, it was a complete train wreck.	0
5663	Arctic Monkeys at the Apollo	Only for Arctic Monkeys fans	1
5664	Donnie Darko	An intense sci-fi.	2
5665	Batman Begins	Bloody excellent.	2

5667	Major Payne	loved it, hilarious	2
5668	Laura	My favorite film noir of all time is The Killers with Burt Lancaster and the gorgeous Eva Gardner.  But Laura has got to the be my second favorie.  Gene Tierney is hot and Dana Andrews is so perfect as the detective.  	2
5669	Signs	With few special effects for a sci-fi movie, Signs is highly effective at building suspense and creating Hitchcock-style, heart pounding moments.	2
5670	Tucker & Dale vs Evil	Interesting premise, and nice casting with Labine and Tudyk. It has a few funny moments, but it feels very repetitive, which is a big failure for such a short film. It's a shame, this had potential.	0
5671	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Original, different, stripbook style movie	2
5672	Requiem for a Dream	One of the most memorable scores I can remember, but I wasn't very keen on the pacing, acting, or script. Resides in mediocrity.	0

5677	The Godfather	Don Corleone losses his elder son and is attacked by rival gang...in this condition, his other son takes the charge and comes in command.he starts punishing the people who killed his brother and attacked his father. With the course of time, he becomes 'The Godfather'	2
5678	Tropic Thunder	If you've ever worked in theater, you will totally know all of these characters! This movie was hilarious, and really a joy to watch. I won't say Oscars, but it was a really good time at the cinema. 	2
5679	Farewell, My Queen	More of a fascinating study of obsession than a detailed examination of the fall of Marie Antoinette. Great performances, and quietly rapturous. 	2
5680	RoboCop 3	One Word: Why?	1
5681	The Matrix	there hasn't been a movie since that has really given me such a broad spectrum of intellectual, visual, emotional, and even spiritual entertainment all in one package.. honestly forever a classic. 	2
5682	Arrival	Tight, beautifully shot, and left me thinking for days afterwards.	2
5683	Close Encounters of the Third Kind	movie was garbage	0
5684	The Last Winter	Strong atmosphere and a decent musical score weren't enough to save this movie from a story so astonishingly bad that only Al Gore could appreciate it.	0
5685	Drive	Openening sequence is great... its all downhill from there. The writing, especially the bad guys dialogue, is terrible. It sounds like a 14 year old trying to imagine what a bad guy sounds like. 	2
5686	Regression	"It would be good movie, but where is the first structure of script? We couldn't even meet characters in the beginning of movie; thus, it didn't work well, yet not bad.
"	2
5687	Band of Brothers	"One of the most poignant displays of courage and heroism ever portrayed on the small screen. Really really entertaining as well. Hanks takes the grit and drama of Saving Private Ryan and elaborates upon it in every way possible. Historically accurate and cinematically unparalleled. I would suggest watching one or two episodes at a time. You'll want time to digest each one...
"	2
5688	Toy Story	One of the best animated movies i've seen, ahead of its time.	2
5689	The Sword in the Stone	A childhood obsession. The movie I've seen every day, for years, unrelentlessly. The ÜberVHS. The curse of my family. The thing that made my world go round.	2
5690	We Own the Night	Bunch of stereotypes thrown together to create a cliché plot with very cliché characters.	0
5691	Jaws	The father of the modern summer blockbuster.	2
5692	Starship Troopers	I don't do comments as you can tell, BUT. I have to say this is probabaly one of the more hated movie among my peers. Too bad. What you don't see is that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Think not? Ever see an Ed Wood movie? Crap....,but cult crap held in high regard and looked to as an inspiration. This is the movie Ed Wood or Robert Lippert would have made if they had the technology and the money. If you watch those 50's sci-fi B movies over and over you know where this came fr	0
5693	Trainspotting	great second film.  too bad danny boyle bust his nut with this movie.  everything else he's made is rubbish.	0
5694	True Romance	My favorite least known movie. Since I heard of this movie from my movie friend Adam, I have preached the greatness of this movie like it was a religion. Hero arc, soundtrack, great actors, great dialogue, and great camera/lighting...nothing not to like. Bloody and violent but if you would enjoy this movie enjoy it fully and watch the unrated version which has one of the most pivotal but violent scenes that I think is necessary	2
5695	Don Jon	It's very funny and I'll give it that; there are several sight gags that made me laugh every single time they came up. And it's clever in most of its execution, but something about it didn't quite work for me. The last 20-30 minutes just struck me as having come more-or-less without any of the character moments to sell it. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure I liked it. 	0
5696	The Goonies	Just the best man, you gotta love the goonies!!!!!!	2
5697	Lucky People Center International	"The most amazing thing ever.

5698	Finding Nemo	Excellent!!!	2
5699	Memento	This movie stays with you long after you finish watching it. Excellent and original.	2
5700	Braveheart	funny (not intentionally), historically wrong, 	1
5701	The Wolf of Wall Street	This is my favorite movie ever	2
5702	Hell	Very, very lame.	0
5703	The Invitation	Although it's slow paced, the first and second arcs of the Invitation are building up the tension phenomenally, while creating believable characters and relationships. However, the reveal is disappointingly obvious and the finale falls short with no real payoff at the end.	0
5704	Boyhood	This movie is a hauntingly accurate portrayal of many aspects of growing up. It is an emotionally exhausting film that depicts extraordinarily realistic and multi-layered character development across the cast. In a way, I almost regret watching it because it is a painful reminder of how life can often be unpredictable yet thoroughly uneventful.  	2
5705	Halloween	JAMIE LEE CURTIS !	1
5706	Thirst	Really didn't expect what I got, it was a pleasant surprise to find that this was really a dark romantic comedy and not a horror picture. Great date movie. A bit of bloat though.	2
5707	The Perks of Being a Wallflower	Better than any notion I could have had. Incredibly moving. Formed a mental hollow, I can't stop thinking about it.	1
5708	Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back	Add 30 to your score if you're stoned.	1
5709	Wayne's World	Hilarious.	2
5710	Red	Overly corny, shallow characters, obvious plot. Found this boring and annoying.	0
5711	Casino Royale	Horrible bond movie.	0
5712	The Equalizer	LIght, straight forward, but a lot of fun scenes.  	2
5713	The Departed	100th	1
5714	The Searchers	An uneven film. At it's best, it's great. At it's worst, it's Ford's trademark brand of painful comic relief and/or melodrama.	0
5715	Lars and the Real Girl	have to agree with commenter lonelypanda - the intentions of the movie are great, gosling's acting is pretty good, but the mood just doesn't come across well, the whole thing feels fake. 	1
5716	Ultraviolet	Some good action, but a HORRIBLE story.	0
5717	Stalker	A slow and philosophical adaptation of a russian sci-fi novel written by Strugacky brothers (dir. A. Tarkovsky). A stalker (guide) leads a writer and a scientist into a Zone, a place with it's own rules, abandoned area which is a remain of an enigmatic alien visit, seeking a place that is rumored to grant human wishes. Most of scenes are based on examining motives and characters of these three people and meaning of human life. The movie's setting - a dystopical unknown (post)industrial landscape being reclaimed by nature - add a lot to the it's overall impact.	2
5718	The Big Boss	Great in childhood memories, but terrible to watch at adult age, except for the moves - the likely ones, though.	2
5719	300	this is sparta... this movie spawned one of the most epic memes of all time	1

5724	Female Trouble	the firstJohn Waters film I saw. Have been a fan os his warped and depraved mind ever since.	0
5725	Donnie Darko	If I could rank a movie -1000 I would.  Most despised movie of all time.  More irritating are the people who insist I just don't get this pos.  I get it, I just thought it the most boring flick of all time. 	0
5726	Birdman	Iñárritu got the Oscar.	2
5727	Elite Squad: The Enemy Within	add some political and action elements to cidade de deus and there you go!	2
5728	Corridor	Best thriller I've seen in a long time. 	2
5729	Bewitched	Next time write a script BEFORE you start shooting.  And if you HAVE to make features from old TV shows, try to make them better than the original material.	0
5730	Mad Max: Fury Road	I really loved this film. Despite it being just one long chase scene back and forth, the stunts and acting were phenomenal. The story was deep enough to fulfill my needs while light enough to be carried on wheels. Characters were vibrant and so were the scenes. Charlize Theron did a great job headlining the film as well.	2
5731	Limelight	The simplicity in this movie is amazing! Felt in love with every single scene!	2
5732	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Class movie.	2
5733	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	the best!	2
5734	Scarface	Ne çektin be Tony..	1
5735	The Stepford Wives	The original film is a classic of horror and to be honest, it totally creeped me out.  So, with a cast like Kidman, Walken, Broderick and Close, I was expecting something decent.  This remake is literally a joke and more of a parody of the original than anything else.  There is nothing particularly subtle about the humor and the horror is all but gone.  Not worth anyone's time, not even for a laugh.  	0
5736	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2	i liked it a lot and the best harry potter movie.	1

5746	Normal Adolescent Behavior	One of the dumbest things I've ever seen.	1
5747	Taxi Driver	A must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.	2
5748	Michael Clayton	great drama. george at his best	2
5749	Pan's Labyrinth	The movie that made me fall in love with Guillermo del Toro. Stunningly beautiful cinematography with a heart-wrenching story. One of the few perfect films.	2
5750	Sorry to Bother You	A surreal, satirical, and very timely commentary on American society: the nonsensical and the unjust in our reality (people working full time unable to afford housing, black folks in the US needing to 'talk white' to succeed in business, etc.) are given the Twilight Zone treatment, and the result is a movie that is bizarre, funny, and honest. It's intentionally over-the-top and strange, and though it's been characterized as such, it's not sci-fi or fantasy. I read it as an allegory.	1
5751	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Just watched this the other day and it still has some of the best dream sequences I can think of.  There are some fun sequels and all, but this really set the template and I don't think it was ever met again.	2
5752	Religulous	Entertaining, but just as narrow-minded as the people he interviews.	2
5753	Jack and Jill	I will never know why adam sandler keeps making such terrible movies and how al pacino agreed to play in this one.	0
5754	Pulp Fiction	masterpiece	2
5755	Children of Men	Absolutely stunning, probably my favorite film.	2
5756	Cloverfield	One of the best thrillers I've ever seen.	2
5757	Battle: Los Angeles	Ugh, painful. The only character trait that any of them had was good/tough guy and the plot was . . . there wasn't a plot. No plot, no characters, only big explosions. Please, don't watch this.	0
5758	Drive	More. More like this.	1
5759	Alien	The one that got me into loving film. Excellent cinematography, eerie atmosphere and brilliant character interaction. Just about perfect.	2
5760	God Bless America	I had high hopes for this movie based on the trailers, but half way through I was just begging for it to be over. There are WAY too many endless rants from both the male and female characters.	0

5780	The Colony	Horribly sexist.	0
5781	The Birth of a Nation	The importance of this film can NOT be understated. It is the precursor to all modern Hollywood films. While its subject matter is reprehensible, its greatness is in its technical breakthroughs. While its not a film to shown to impressionable children, it is of inestimable value to anyone who wishes to understand the art of filmmaking.	2
5782	Jackie Brown	While there is no such thing as a perfect film, for me this is as close as it gets.  Jackie Brown is endlessly watchable, with an unexpectedly amazing cast, a huge amount of great dialogue, and not a boring moment in its over 2 1/2 hours.  I notice something new every time I watch this movie, and I look forward to watching it many more times.	2
5783	Titanic	o-ver-ra-ted	1
5784	Gladiator	grate story 	1
5785	Annabelle: Creation	Overall, as a movie in itself it's just okay, but when thought of in context as the kind of movie it is, it's pretty good.	2
5786	Hero	One of the most beautiful movies you will ever put in your eyes.	2
5787	Skyfall	one of the best movies ive seen this year daniel craig is by far the best bond ever !!!!!!!	2
5788	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	For the first time Wes Anderson made a movie that I did not care for and I place the blame mostly on the lack of an Owen Wilson writing credit.  Anderson relies too much on the formula that drove Tennenbaums visual appeal but left out the all important storyline and character development.	0
5789	Donnie Darko	It's the most incredibly mind boggling I've seen in my entire life	2
5790	Woman in Gold	Extemely moving, sometimes disturbing.  Helen Mirren is marvelous and the others are good.	2
5791	Fun Size	Really just revoltingly terrible. And an inordinate number of pedophilia jokes for something aimed at teens. Tonally ridiculous, and has exactly 0 laughs throughout the *entire* thing. Yuck.	0
5792	The Raid: Redemption	Şimdi sadece gerilim/aksiyon/dövüş türlerinde değerlendirirsek hakikaten şahane bir film. Dövüş sekansları dehşetti. Gerilmemek de mümkün değildi. Ama hikayeye/senaryoya baktığımızda elde pek bir şey yok. Vasat hikaye/enfes dövüş koreografilerine sahip vasat bir film. Hikayeye ve kötü karaktere daha fazla önem verilseydi keşke. 	0
5793	The Devil's Rejects	Loved House of 1000 Corpses not so hot on Devils rEjects 	1
5794	Predestination	Brilliant!!	2
5795	Transformers: Dark of the Moon	I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is. It's just so ridiculous, you want to cry and laugh at the same time.	0
5796	Serial Mom	Fucking amazing. Especially the pussy willows.	2
5797	Inside Man	Horrible music, interesting story	0
5798	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Fantastic Harrison Ford in a great action adventure film	2
5799	Sin City	The misogyny in Frank Miller's stuff is so over the top it's almost campy, but this movie was such a revelation visually that it deserves respect. It was truly a comic book come to life. 300 is trash, though.	1
5800	City of God	Great Decoupage! Fantastic Cinematography and excellent Direction, but the story which claimed to be a true story and scenario is weak.	1
5801	Paranormal Activity	Very Very Disappointing. This movie had tons of hype from the beginning, but it never really delivered. You wait and wait for the climax thinking it's going to be a crazy ending, but it never comes. This was just another sub-par horror.	0
5802	A Simple Favor	I'd like to remember the trailer instead of the whole movie, actually.	0
5803	Cars	I feel high emotions when i watching this movie.	2
5804	Into the Wild	inspiring 	2
5805	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Quirky, overly referential, and a lot of fun...	0

5808	Malibu's Most Wanted	Wonderbread dumpster = beautiful	2
5809	Cars	Very good	2
5810	Scooby-Doo	I loved the cartoon and the movie just doesn't do it justice. 	1
5811	Donnie Darko	interesting movie.. full of mystery..	2
5812	Take Shelter	Worst possible ending.	0
5813	Seven Samurai	Excellent in every degree. An engaging epic that truly lets you know the characters and feel for them. Everytime one of the seven is struck down, you feel a part of you go down with them. The final battle portion of this film is excellent and the aftermath is well directed and key to the whole film. You must see this film.	2
5814	Toy Story	An all time classic and a pioneer of the 3D animation movement. Woody and Buzz Lightyear are two of the greatest movie characters of all time, in my opinion. 	1
5815	Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story	PEOPLE COME HERE TO DANCE EROTICALLY	1
5816	Dumb and Dumber	Hilariously stupid, this movie defines many of the comedic and sarcastic sayings used still today.	0
5817	My Fair Lady	One of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady is simply exquisite. While she doesn't do her own singing, Hepburn is just fantastic, as is Harrison and the rest of the cast. While it drags at times due to its length, this film is still a must-see.	2
5818	Taxi Driver	 a Mini-Review  	1
5819	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	Among the funniest movies in the world, but I hardly finished it :)	1
5820	The Sting	The quintessential heist-movie. 	2
5821	The Fault in Our Stars	okay? okay 	2
5822	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	just - perfect	2
5823	The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers	The bridge film in the trilogy and as such does not stand alone as well as Fellowship or ROTK. But that said, it is still brilliant, with a brilliant turn by Andy Serkis, who can't be praised enough for bringing Gollum to life. 	2
5824	Fair Game	Engrossing thanks to Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, but many elements don't elevate beyond adequate.	2
5825	The Interview	An incredibly tense film with a wonderful script and great performances. Amazing considering its low budget and the fact the action mostly takes place in one room.	2
5826	Obyknovennyy fashizm	It's not a Mondo's but a very detailled documentary.	2
5827	Mulholland Drive	Crap, crap, crap. I can't see what everybody finds about this movie.	0
5828	Prisoners	"A truly great modern thriller.
 "	2
5829	Midsommar	I really liked the aesthetics of this movie, but I just don't like realistic gore. It's disturbing.	2
5830	Brick	Amazing movie! I love it!!!	2
5831	Yesterday	Awesome movie. Funny, yet without the normal stupid Hollywood standard parts. Well, almost. But good enough!	2
5832	Ford v Ferrari	The racing sequences are great, but its really the lead-up to the climactic race that does the heavy lifting. The race is almost an afterthought, with the real conflict of the film being not between Ford and Ferrari, but between Ford and the race team the company's assembling. The film is ultimately about drawing the distinction between the art of racing ( a body moving through space a time) and the machinations of industry that undergird that experience's existence.	1
5833	South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut	The best comedy and/or musical ever made. Almost hands-down.	2
5834	Primer	Though I always enjoy a good time-travel flick, I enjoyed this movie more for the revolutionary writing that I hope inspires future filmmakers. This film made me feel like I was watching the result of a sudoku puzzle being ran through a movie projector. It makes the viewer itch for complete understanding and capitalizes on rewatchability.	2
5835	We Own the Night	Bunch of stereotypes thrown together to create a cliché plot with very cliché characters.	0
5836	Jaws	The father of the modern summer blockbuster.	2

5840	Waking Life	The crowning jewel in Linklater's portfolio of sub-art school trash. Looks interesting, but the monologues are mindnumbing and the overall tone is unrelentingly obnoxious.	0
5841	Children of Men	An all-time favorite.	2
5842	Repo! The Genetic Opera	I really loved this film, start to finish.  Lots of names I had never heard of before and a few that I recognized (Alexa Vega got super hot; look up Machete Kills).  Every character had numerous flaws save for Shiloh, and there was a variety of musical numbers; Pat Benatar even makes an appearance.  The story ends in tragedy, but it is a great one.  Love, anger, deceit, vengeance, gore, humor and Zydrate!!!  Zydrate comes in a little glass vial!	0
5843	The Descendants	"Clooney has received great reviews, but the actress who played the older daughter stole the show. Enjoyed it, but expected more, given the raves I've read. 

Bring tissues..."	2
5844	House of the Dead	Haha	1
5845	Se7en	What could go wrong in a crime thriller starring Morgan Freeman AND Brad Pitt revolving around the seven deadly sins? Apparently, both nothing and everything. This movie should not be viewed casually.  I would also not suggest eating while watching this movie, as some scenes are rather raw. A must-watch for fans of either actor, it is also a great serial-killer-based mystery thriller.	2
5846	The Silence of the Lambs	shhhh	1
5847	Norsemen	Really not a fan of fecal related humour, I shut it off as soon as it got to that part. The other humour up until then was mediocre at best anyway.[	1
5848	Mirai	If 90 minutes of babies crying and toddlers melting down appeals to you, this is your film.	0
5849	The Sound of Music	This movie is quite long but I still enjoy all the songs.	2
5850	Reign of Fire	Could have been so much more...	1
5851	Troy	So, it is justr me or does anyone else think that Helen looked like a tramp more than a very beautiful maiden?	1
5852	The A-Team	This was REALLY not what I expected out of this movie. Even with Brad Cooper!	0
5853	Shazam!	Typical formulaic superhero movie. Poor kid gets superpowers, first gets beaten by bad guy, wins in the end. His superpower - punching strong, flying. 	0
5854	Dorian Gray	They should have left the picture to the imagination as the movie went on, the horror vibe surrounding it would have gone down a lot better. I liked the Victorian imagery, the time transition and the failed romances were great. A good movie that didn't leave any lasting message for me - I heard the book was supposed to be more to the point and the movie might make more people check that out.	1
5855	Mulholland Drive	what should I say - watch it! And if you didn't get it, what's probably unavoidable, then watch it again and get it! It's one of the greatest plots I've ever seen. 	0
5856	Trainspotting	farg	1
5857	Ocean's 8	hareketli bir pazar sineması tadında ama izlenir doğrusu... dr jivago müziğini de kullanmaları güzel olmuş...	1
5858	Suspiria	I enjoyed this movie but at times the music sort of annoyed me.  It reminded me of some sort of Halloween Party Spooky Sounds CD with the voice in the background of the theme music.  Then as I got used to it I realized that the entire level of dramaticism would not be close to the same if the music were absent or, different.  It was very unique!  Glad to have seen this.  	0

5873	The Thaw	Extremely stupid movie but an interesting concept that is actually based on reality, just too bad it's completely destroyed by a typical horrible hollywood horror movie script, actors, story, moronic actions etc, but people who hate the movie because of the so-called political propaganda are if possible even dumber than the characters in this movie.	0

5875	Yesterday	Awesome movie. Funny, yet without the normal stupid Hollywood standard parts. Well, almost. But good enough!	2
5876	Ford v Ferrari	The racing sequences are great, but its really the lead-up to the climactic race that does the heavy lifting. The race is almost an afterthought, with the real conflict of the film being not between Ford and Ferrari, but between Ford and the race team the company's assembling. The film is ultimately about drawing the distinction between the art of racing ( a body moving through space a time) and the machinations of industry that undergird that experience's existence.	1
5877	South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut	The best comedy and/or musical ever made. Almost hands-down.	2
5878	Primer	Though I always enjoy a good time-travel flick, I enjoyed this movie more for the revolutionary writing that I hope inspires future filmmakers. This film made me feel like I was watching the result of a sudoku puzzle being ran through a movie projector. It makes the viewer itch for complete understanding and capitalizes on rewatchability.	2
5879	We Own the Night	Bunch of stereotypes thrown together to create a cliché plot with very cliché characters.	0
5880	True Romance	The airy and overtly minimalistic soundtrack bleeds with the same naive simplicity and corny romance that leaves the storyline soaking in nostalgia. Written by wonderkid of hyperbole, Quentin Tarantino, the dialogue remains sparkling with coolness and crazed recklessness. The crafty writing is delivered at its peak in the memorable execution scene, superbly matched by the classy performances of Hopper and Walken. Bonnie and Clyde meets Strictly Ballroom and remains inferior to neither one.	2
5881	Space Mutiny	MST3K	1
5882	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Perhaps the greatest adventure ever made	2
5883	Begotten	Don't really know what to think about this movie...........	1
5884	Dark City	You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human. Well, you're not going to find it.. in here. You went looking in the wrong place.	2
5885	Se7en	Beautiful :) But i don't like end of the film.	1
5886	Coherence	I really loved this movie. It needs a PTPM counter (plot twist per minute), if you are up for not eating popcorn, but your fingernails instead (ok don'really do that) then watch this movie.	2
5887	The Shawshank Redemption	One of the most complete and satisfying films ever made.	2
5888	Dead Man Walking	I saw it many year ago. I don't remember any details. i just remember that the whole idea was great and caught me and made me thinking. 	2
5889	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	There should be a disclaimer when you buy your tickets that says: Batman and Superman fight for only like 5 minutes. That's it. The promise of the premise is 5 minutes long. And the entire thing is 3 hours long. Talk about a scam.	0
5890	Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy	I don't think this movie is funny at all, more than anything I found it annoying.	0
5891	Wedding Crashers	isla fisher is hot	2
5892	A Short Film About Love	"This is Kieslowski's commentary on the commandment You shall not commit adultery. 

Adultery is seen as physical love lacking affection. It's sinfulness comes from the fact, that it actually kills the true love. True love is affectionate and rather than being physical is a state of mind."	2
5893	Detachment	for a few. brody's spetacular 	1
5894	Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets	Watched on 29/04/2018	1
5895	Let the Right One In	Cool cinematography. Ginger Snaps does a better job with essentially the same story.	1
5896	Army of Shadows	The only way to be young and get to Melville is through Criterion, and thier first releases from the master captured my attention within minutes, but this is on an entirely differnt level.  Before working with Alain Delon, Melville worked with ensemble casts, and his small pack of Resistance agents are all compelling, and fully realized through silence as much as dialog.  Technically outstanding, artistically perfect.    	2
5897	Gladiator	super super super	1
5898	A Quiet Place	Really well made, original story. Creative, well-acted, incredible use of sound and a remarkably rich story with little dialoge. What's not to like?	2
5899	Fleabag	I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning. I want someone to tell me what to eat, what to like, what to hate, what to rage about, what to listen to, what band to like, what to buy tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about. I want someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, and who to love, and how to tell them. I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life.	0
5900	Made In France	Frappant, mais peu réaliste.	1
5901	Taxi Driver	Great movie. A man that can't stand any more. 	2
5902	American History X	Edward Norton is quite possibly the best actor of his era. He proves that once again in this very, verrry good movie. Very few movies and acting performances make you think about the morals in the movie as much as this one. There are really too many good things to say about this movie. A movie that matters and is oddly enough also kind of cool to watch because of all the toughness in it. Life is too short to hate but it's also too short to not have seen this movie. So watch it... now!	0
5903	The 5 Deadly Venoms	Good simple kung-fu. The law force punishes criminals unjustly and cruely. Lots of people killed.	1
5904	Dr. Dolittle	This is funny as hell. No wait. This is hell, not funny.	1
5905	Titanic 2	Deserving of its few points just because the movie is so absolutely horrible as to be so absolutely hysterical.	1
5906	The Bourne Supremacy	Convincingly choreographed action sequences were all the movie had to offer, in my mind.  I was a fan of the first one, but this is one of those sort of bland sequels that doesn't do much to capture my interest.	1
5907	Gladiator	A powerful touching well made film. Interesting through out and the acting was solid. Sad.	2
5908	Gladiator	You sold me queer giraffes. That line alone puts it up to atleast 80.	1

5912	The Martian	a rare movie because Sean Bean does not die in the end. 	1
5913	Down by Law	roberto benigni numero uno. mucho bene actore he is 	1
5914	Toy Story	great classic!	2
5915	Jason and the Argonauts	Favorite movie of my childhood	2
5916	Super Troopers	Classic stuff, one of the funniest opening ten minutes in ages!	2
5917	Red Dragon	Watch 'Manhunter' instead... 	1
5918	Pearl Harbor	There is bad, then there is insulting. This falls into the later category; I don't care if Bay wants to make his testosterone fueled action films for teenage boys. But when he starts to bastardize history and deliberately bend it to suit his own political agenda, I have to step in and call bullshit.	0
5919	Fight Club	  it's the one! adore it! 	1
5920	Jack Reacher: Never Go Back	Too much cliche in dialogues. Worse than the first one...	0
5921	Citizen Kane	Expected this to be hard work. So many people say things like - I can see that it's great but it's not very enjoyable. That's rubbish. Citizen Kane is energetic, engrossing and Orson Welles is just so watchable.	2
5922	Fight Club	A bit overrated but it is still a fantastic movie.  Fincher is incredibly talented and even though this isn't his best it is a must see for any Fincher fan.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are very good in this as well.  It is also better than the book. 	2
5923	Brideshead Revisited	This film is visually stunning, however the plot and character development lack depth. Watching it was more like viewing a great painting than hearing a great story. 	2
5924	Inception	great movie!	2
5925	United 93	"Very few films these day carry a true emotional punch. Most emotions are forced onto us, some are layered with a heavy hand. Not so with united 93. Those who can vividly remember the events of 9/11, no matter where they were in the world, will know the shock and disbelief they felt. The problem with the tragic events was that it was predictable that Hollywood would get its hands on the day that changed the world. Enter Paul Greengrass.

Mr Greengrass is a blazing talent that has made his name "	2
5926	Never Let Me Go	Bleek and evocative. This movie leaves you thinking about life hard.	2
5927	Master of the Flying Guillotine	This move has had a huge influence on many modern video games and films (the Street Fighter video game, the Kill Bill films).  If you love kung-fu movies see this.	2
5928	Operation Endgame	Awful, poinless, over the top violent move, with a meaningless ending.	0
5929	Thank You for Smoking	Hilarious! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed out loud. Aaron Eckhart was superb, excellent script. I hope this movie does well at the box office.	2
5930	A Star Is Born	sucked me in. great performances and outstanding music.	2
5931	Prom Night	Damn shit movie. Worse movie I think I've ever seen, and I've seen some terrible ones. The characters were both unbelievable and unlikable. The acting was horrid. The plot was unexplainable and horribly predictable. Even the terrible original was better than this hunk of shit.	0
5932	Dances with Wolves	boring	0
5933	Midsommar	Echoes of Wickerman. In some ways better, in some ways worse. I would have preferred to come away with a clearer picture of the communities world view, and of how this extreme vision of community contrasts with the selfish individualism of the outsiders.	0
5934	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Scott Pilgram must fight through the league of evil Ex's, which consists of 8 people, to win over the girl of his dreams. Plus this movie made me feel like I was on acid.  	2
5935	Rat Race	Shitty version of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World	1
5936	Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan	KKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!	1
5937	Toy Story	This movie is truly a work of art, an was a lauching pad for cgi animation. 	2
5938	Donnie Darko	Intriguing!	2
5939	Batman	Campiest movie ever. Thank god for those noble porpoises.	1
5940	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	scored purely for how i liked it at age 12, no idea what i'd give after a watch now	2
5941	Hot Tub Time Machine	Sometimes funny, but at other times flat. It relies too much on boobs and off colour juvenile jokes. There are so many gay, aids, rape and women jokes I can handle. 	0
5942	Cloverfield	It should be a 30 minute short-film.  The handy-cam shooting is interesting for about the first 20 minutes, then it just wears on you.  Unless you feel really compelled to see this movie, find something better to watch.	0
5943	World Trade Center	disgustingly disrespectful	1
5944	Leviathan	Cold to the last breath. A painfull swallow of Vodka. 	0
5945	Blue Valentine	Very strong movie, great performances and intelligent script. I love it. Ryan Goslin is so great in the row. 	2
5946	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	A masterpiece of art-direction, cinematography, casting and storytelling. Often overlooked in any discussion of the best film in the trilogy because of RotK, I'd put it right at the top. In fact so far it is the only film I've seen to be given the perfect 100. 	2
5947	Alien	An almost perfect movie. Great villain, great mystery, masterfully executed.	2
5948	Fast Five	A guilty pleasure involving explosions, heists, car chases, and a surprising amount of character payoff. The only real problem I have is the fight between Rock and Diesel. Buuuuuuullllllshhhhhiiiiiiiit.	2
5949	Noah	By far the worst Aronofsky/Mansell Collaboration.  Plot was not great but it was partially redeemed by some scenes with gorgeous visuals (The creation story comes to mind.	2
5950	The Terminator	COME WID ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE	1
5951	Assassin's Creed	Some action was kind-of cool, impossible to clearly hear dialog over constant blaring music, honestly just a boring movie with lame characters.	0
5952	The Incredibles	Would have had a higher rating if it wasn't for Holly Hunters speech impediment!	0
5953	Stardust	Unwatchable and unbearable.  An insult to the acting talent involved.  I wish I could unwatch it.	0
5954	An American Crime	One of those based on a true story films that astounds.  The screenwriter mostly succeeds in portraying seriously evil people thinking they're doing the right thing.	2
5955	Into the Wild	Read the book, saw the movie, wasn't disappointed. 	2
5956	Hardcore Henry	As it turns out, it's hard to have any semblance of a plot when your movie is in first-person POV and your protagonist doesn't speak. 	0
5957	Memories of Matsuko	One of the most heartbreaking movies i have ever seen. It`s like a great greek tragedy of modern times, told in form of a musical!Sounds strange? You have to see for yourself and witness a brilliant picture.	2
5958	Adam & Paul	Wonderfully understated.  A tragi-comedy.  Beautifully observed.  We never get to find out who is Adam and who is Paul, but it doesn't matter.	2
5959	The Incredibles	As of 2017, I still consider this the best Pixar movie ever made. Memorable characters, great pacing, interesting premise. If any movie deserves a sequel, it's this one.	2
5960	Operation Endgame	Awful, poinless, over the top violent move, with a meaningless ending.	0
5961	Thank You for Smoking	Hilarious! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed out loud. Aaron Eckhart was superb, excellent script. I hope this movie does well at the box office.	2
5962	Hero	The Politics are a bit disturbing, but it's a top film, beautifully shot, yadda yadda. Tony Leung is astonishing.	2
5963	John Wick	It is not often you encounter a movie so pointless and idiotic and yet so well made and fun to watch. I like slayers. I like Keanu Reeves. I liked this movie.	2
5964	Lucy	Really loved this movie. It was much deeper than what I expected. It makes you think about the possibilities you posses and does it in an entertaining way. If you you are in anyway into the deeper side of Buddhist philosophy some the theories will be familiar.	2
5965	Citizen Kane	Bravely conceived and masterfully executed, the film's influence is still felt even now. A technical masterpiece, combined with a structure befitting its stature, Orson Welles crafted a film which will justifiably continue to be considered one of the best ever.	2
5966	Jungle 2 Jungle	A businessman (Allen) learns of an illegitimate son who has been raised in a jungle tribe. Named Mimi-Siku (\Cat pee\), the boy tries to win the heart of his busy father on a trip to that OTHER jungle, New York City.	1
5967	Jason X	This was, oddly, not as terrible as I expected	1
5968	Terminator Genisys	T-800 is a real boy!	1
5969	There Will Be Blood	"Top Film at the lolo Awards 2007
 
 Won 7 Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Editing and Best Original Score. Also Nominee for Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing."	2
5970	Gerry	It's like a German Expressionist film, without the German, or the Expressionism. One of the most painful movie-going experiences of my life.  I recall leaning over to my friend during the extended driving scene at the beginning, whispering, Wouldn't it be awful if the whole movie were like this? And so it was. I dunno. Maybe if I'd been warned beforehand how it would be I might have appreciated it more, but with an Oscar-winning screenwriter participating, I expected something different. 	2
5971	Let the Right One In	Quite possibly one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, and greatly contributes to its overall dark mood. I'm very curious as to see what the North American version is going to be like, but I highly doubt it will be as good.	2
5972	Harold and Maude	When I first saw Harold and Maude, I fell in love with it. Quirky and brilliant!	2
5973	Xew Xew	Masterpiece 	2
5974	Bang, Bang, You're Dead	Good Foster performance but overall rather average film.	2

5980	Ashes of Time Redux	horse love	1
5981	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	amazing.  just, amazing.	2
5982	Power Rangers	Çok klişe durumlar vardı. Ekibin uyumu iyi değildi. Müzikler çok kötüydü. Beklediğimi veremedi.	1
5983	Tremors	This is a perfect genre film.	2
5984	Public Enemies	Gorgeous film, especially the stylish gangster costumes. Depp and Bale both give good, sparse performances. But the story and the characters never really go anywhere, and yet it managed to go on and on. It was waaaay too long. The text epilogues were totally cheap--the script did not earn the emotional punch that is the fate of Purvis.	0
5985	The Civil War	the haunting melodies and multiple narrators give this documentary a distinct and impressive flavor. David McCullough is the primary narrator, and does a fabulous job. On top of that, you have one of the pivotal events that shaped America into the nation it is today. It also endlessly exciting and humorous and moving. Shelby Foote became a star after this was televised, and it's small wonder  	2
5986	Greed	Silent, but deadly. 	1
5987	Shaun of the Dead	One of my favourite films ever. Everything about it is perfect. Acting,scripting, filming, direction, sound, lighting. All of its perfect and it's such a funny film.	2
5988	The Music Room	My first Satyajit Ray film and I must say the attention to detail and sound is spectacular. The portrayal of the class system and the privileged society is enthralling. The non-linear arc was tough to follow at first, but developed into a unique style. The Criterion Collection Blu-Ray is spectacular!	2
5989	Who Killed Captain Alex?	Welcome to Uganda. 	1
5990	Best in Show	Excellent movie. The entire cast does such a good job with all their characters. Rent or buy the DVD and make sure to watch the deleted scenes as well as the movie (of course).	2
5991	Red	Overly corny, shallow characters, obvious plot. Found this boring and annoying.	0
5992	Casino Royale	Horrible bond movie.	0
5993	The Equalizer	LIght, straight forward, but a lot of fun scenes.  	2
5994	The Departed	100th	1
5995	The Searchers	An uneven film. At it's best, it's great. At it's worst, it's Ford's trademark brand of painful comic relief and/or melodrama.	0
5996	Lars and the Real Girl	have to agree with commenter lonelypanda - the intentions of the movie are great, gosling's acting is pretty good, but the mood just doesn't come across well, the whole thing feels fake. 	1
5997	Ultraviolet	Some good action, but a HORRIBLE story.	0
5998	Stalker	A slow and philosophical adaptation of a russian sci-fi novel written by Strugacky brothers (dir. A. Tarkovsky). A stalker (guide) leads a writer and a scientist into a Zone, a place with it's own rules, abandoned area which is a remain of an enigmatic alien visit, seeking a place that is rumored to grant human wishes. Most of scenes are based on examining motives and characters of these three people and meaning of human life. The movie's setting - a dystopical unknown (post)industrial landscape being reclaimed by nature - add a lot to the it's overall impact.	2
5999	The Big Boss	Great in childhood memories, but terrible to watch at adult age, except for the moves - the likely ones, though.	2
6000	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	There should be a disclaimer when you buy your tickets that says: Batman and Superman fight for only like 5 minutes. That's it. The promise of the premise is 5 minutes long. And the entire thing is 3 hours long. Talk about a scam.	0
6001	Touch of Evil	Just watch any scene to be aware of how it came close to perfection.	2
6002	Made In France	Frappant, mais peu réaliste.	1

6016	Donnie Darko	Intriguing!	2
6017	Batman	Campiest movie ever. Thank god for those noble porpoises.	1
6018	The Great Happiness Space: Tale of an Osaka Love Thief	An interesting documentary for this American to watch, giving glimpses into a culture I know little about.  What begins as a simple look into Japanese male host clubs, delves deeper into how both the hosts and the women they entertain are affected by the relationships formed.	2
6019	Saving Private Ryan	A stunning opening - one of the best in cinema - but then it's (Hollywod) business as usual.	2
6020	Watchmen	Horrible movie.	0
6021	Punch-Drunk Love	I really like it if I assume that everything after the door-kicking scene is the fantasy of Sandler's character - it's exactly what a man who doesn't view women as people would fantasize. But that's not supported within the film itself, so it's just a cardboard drama with no reason for the characters to act as they do.	0
6022	(500) Days of Summer	The perfect combination of good actors, good script, good music and the real life.	2
6023	An Inconvenient Truth	Would have liked it more if it wasn't a propoganda piece for Al gore, like he's the saviour of humanity. I also didn't give a shit for his personal life and his personal misfortunes, I don't see how that matters in the overall picture of humanity. I guess he's trying to fit into the mythical slot of Noah.. 	0
6024	Alfie	Absolutely brilliant. Caine was made for this role. Hilarious and charming, great interaction between characters and beatifully filmed in 60's London. Caine aptly fluctuates between barefaced cheek and flirt to loneliness and despair effortlessly. Much better than i thought it would be	2
6025	Xanadu	A blast from the past - Grease meets Singing in the Rain (on roller skates no less!)  yep they had some good drugs in 1980	2
6026	Zelig	I have to admit. I only saw 30 minutes of the film and got bored. I thought it a great idea, but the jokes are not funny in my opinion (at least in these 30 minutes). I will probably try another day.	0
6027	Juno	Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. If you like that song you also like this lovely movie.	2
6028	Pride & Prejudice	Not normally the kind of movie I'd see, but I really liked it.	2
6029	The Truman Show	This is one of the most MOVING and symbolic movies I've ever seen.  Jim Carrey's vulnerability and determination as the truth unfolds is at once heart-breaking and inspiring.  This movie truly touched me.  	2
6030	The 5 Deadly Venoms	In my opinion, this is the greatest kung fu film of all time. Wild styles, expert choreography, and real talent on the part of the actors meet one of the genre's most intriguing stories. As in any martial arts film, the fights are the most important thing, and the battles featured here are lengthy, meaty, and a complete joy to watch. If you are looking for an introduction to the martial arts genre, there is no better movie than this one.	1
6031	Gladiator	Its a great movie, i would watch it again	2
6032	Trainspotting	Superb! One of the bests movies I have seen.	2
6033	The Shrine	Started out really bad but picked up in the end.	0
6034	Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid	Seriously shocking... the only movie I've seen where pawpaws grow on mangrove trees, and you reach the top of a waterfall by sailing up-stream! Pathetic.	1
6035	This Is the End	I was expecting so much more. I'm a cheap laugh and Seth Rogen usually gets my sides splitting, but this film just didn't do it for me. I can't recommend it to anyone, and that makes me sad.	0
6036	Goodfellas	Outstanding script, excellent performances, epic story.	2
6037	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	First one was the best!	2
6038	Red Cliff	Phenomenal wars in field	1
6039	Toy Story	buzz, you rock my world	1

6042	Female Trouble	the firstJohn Waters film I saw. Have been a fan os his warped and depraved mind ever since.	0
6043	Donnie Darko	If I could rank a movie -1000 I would.  Most despised movie of all time.  More irritating are the people who insist I just don't get this pos.  I get it, I just thought it the most boring flick of all time. 	0
6044	Birdman	Iñárritu got the Oscar.	2
6045	Elite Squad: The Enemy Within	add some political and action elements to cidade de deus and there you go!	2
6046	Corridor	Best thriller I've seen in a long time. 	2
6047	Bewitched	Next time write a script BEFORE you start shooting.  And if you HAVE to make features from old TV shows, try to make them better than the original material.	0
6048	Dog Day Afternoon	A nervous thriller staring Pacino and Cazale, former Corleone brothers, as inexperienced bank-robbers on a hot Brooklyn day. Released in 1975, this movie resonates an uneasy turbulence about the precarious nature of the United States, perhaps seen in Pacino's character of Sonny, a decent man who finds himself in an indecent society. Police brutality, Vietnam, and qualms about homosexual identity violently corrode what was intended to be a simple bank heist...	2
6049	My Name Is Bruce	Everyone liked Bubba Ho-Tep. I really have no idea what I'd make of this film if I wasn't already a Bruce Campbell fan. Thankfully, I won't have this problem, and can really enjoy even more Bruce Campbell.	2
6050	City of God	My opinion is just that: Extremely ordinary, even everyday, setting captured with extraordinary cinematography and fairly realistic acting, threatens to mask the message.	2
6051	Punch-Drunk Love	"beautiful beautiful beautiful

6053	Alone in the Wilderness	A fascinating look into a life that some people dream about but never go through with. Dick Proenneke is a about as authentic as they come and documents his life and work in incredible detail.	2
6054	A Good Year	the film itself is predictable but entertaining. It's the setting and cinematography that make this film worth seeing.	2
6055	Werckmeister Harmonies	The real essence of Cinema for me.	1
6056	Hachiko: A Dog's Story	Probably the saddest movie I've ever seen... If you don't cry while watching this movie, you're not human... 	0
6057	13 Tzameti	Sick!	0
6058	Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels	Damn good movie, love it, want to see more of this sort movies!	2
6059	Memento	..And then out of the blue comes ''Memento''.. A brilliant and strange idea that turns into a movie and blows your mind away. An absolute ''Must See''.	2
6060	Goodfellas	Funny at times, but again, I disagree with the majority in that the movie just doesn't do it for me1	0
6061	Falling Leaves	The scene in the picture contains most of the film's interest.	0
6062	The Phantom of the Opera	I totally love the musical, but the movie... just wasn't quite up to it.	1
6063	Melancholia	"TITS
"	1
6064	Mad Max: Fury Road	Very fun movie, don't expect any type of story. 	2
6065	District 9	good	2
6066	Se7en	great!	2
6067	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom	Brilliant film! One for all the family to enjoy.	2
6068	Cocaine Cowboys	Very informative. Over all the film gives a very concise overview how the drugbarons took control over Miami and literally built the place. Then they started fighting between each other and hell broke loose. The action is hard packed. Huge editing and short clips. In the same minute you can hear several persons speaking. Often this technique bothered me - especially in the beginning - and didn't work very well but it helped keep the pace going which also suited the film very well.	2
6069	The House of the Devil	More style than substance, Ti West crafts an effective thriller in the vein of Dario Argento and his giallo horror contemporaries. Well acted, well shot, and, interestingly enough, very much a 1980s period piece. Worth seeing in the theater or via Amazon.com's rental service.	2
6070	Se7en	Beautiful :) But i don't like end of the film.	1
6071	Coherence	I really loved this movie. It needs a PTPM counter (plot twist per minute), if you are up for not eating popcorn, but your fingernails instead (ok don'really do that) then watch this movie.	2
6072	The Shawshank Redemption	One of the most complete and satisfying films ever made.	2
6073	Dead Man Walking	I saw it many year ago. I don't remember any details. i just remember that the whole idea was great and caught me and made me thinking. 	2
6074	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	There should be a disclaimer when you buy your tickets that says: Batman and Superman fight for only like 5 minutes. That's it. The promise of the premise is 5 minutes long. And the entire thing is 3 hours long. Talk about a scam.	0
6075	Touch of Evil	Just watch any scene to be aware of how it came close to perfection.	2
6076	Made In France	Frappant, mais peu réaliste.	1
6077	Taxi Driver	Great movie. A man that can't stand any more. 	2
6078	American History X	Edward Norton is quite possibly the best actor of his era. He proves that once again in this very, verrry good movie. Very few movies and acting performances make you think about the morals in the movie as much as this one. There are really too many good things to say about this movie. A movie that matters and is oddly enough also kind of cool to watch because of all the toughness in it. Life is too short to hate but it's also too short to not have seen this movie. So watch it... now!	0
6079	The 5 Deadly Venoms	Good simple kung-fu. The law force punishes criminals unjustly and cruely. Lots of people killed.	1
6080	Cars	I feel high emotions when i watching this movie.	2
6081	Into the Wild	inspiring 	2
6082	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Quirky, overly referential, and a lot of fun...	0
6083	The Machine	Wow! That hit the spot.	2
6084	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Such a wasted potential...	0
6085	Malibu's Most Wanted	Wonderbread dumpster = beautiful	2
6086	Cars	Very good	2
6087	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Love it!	2
6088	Easy A	Stanley Tucci is the MAN!!	1
6089	Great Balls of Fire!	I dislike Dennis Quaid, but I enjoyed him as a pedophile. 	2
6090	Halloween	JAMIE LEE CURTIS !	1
6091	Thirst	Really didn't expect what I got, it was a pleasant surprise to find that this was really a dark romantic comedy and not a horror picture. Great date movie. A bit of bloat though.	2
6092	The Perks of Being a Wallflower	Better than any notion I could have had. Incredibly moving. Formed a mental hollow, I can't stop thinking about it.	1
6093	Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back	Add 30 to your score if you're stoned.	1
6094	Wayne's World	Hilarious.	2
6095	Logan	Very well made, I personally give it 4 out of 5 stars because it was dark, & had scenes that were sad. The best Wolverine movie in my opinion.	1
6096	The Reckless Moment	Of such a tragic beauty that only Ophüls could conceive.	2
6097	Finding Nemo	"javascript:void(0);
Submit"	0
6098	Let the Right One In	It would be SO difficult to make this film better, and I firmly believe that the american remake is going to totally ruin the story. This film is so beautiful, and so subtle, and the acting is astounding. 	2
6099	Taxi Driver	5	1
6100	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	Indiana Mulder and the Revenge of the CGI-Demon One thumb down for story, effects and characters, one up a bit for there is an Indiana feeling sometimes.	0
6101	Pacific Rim	boredom	0
6102	Fruitvale Station	Reality is so much crueler than fiction.	0
6103	Cinema Paradiso	Maybe the greatest love story ever filmed! A tribute to cinema! Beautiful! Exciting! Touching! Awesome! Perfect!	2
6104	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Amazing, classic. Great performance by Jack. 	2
6105	Paris, Texas	I think I almost cried during the last couple scenes, either because I was emotionally moved or because I didn't want to blink, I'm not sure which. If you like the character studies in The Searchers and/or Taxi Driver, or the marginal America of Easy Rider and/or Five Easy Pieces, then you'll probably like this. Beautiful cinematography and brilliant performances all around to boot.	2
6106	Because of Winn-Dixie	All I remember about this movie was that Dave Matthews brought a jar of pickles to a party. I think of this any time I hear Dave Matthews. 	2
6107	A Serious Man	The Coen's films are hit or miss.  This is a miss.  After watching this film, if I didn't know they were Jewish, I would swear they were raging antisemites.  Every character is more grotesque than the next.  I watched a little of the extras, hoping they would explain why they made this piece of shit.  Alas, they did not. They claimed to be drawing upon real life experience?  If so, they must be seriously damaged!  No plot, no point, abysmal ending, excruciating.  WTF?	0
6108	The Third Man	This is the one film I'd recommend to anyone who claims to hate black and white films. The camera work, the lighting, the snappy dialogue, the fact that it was written by Graham Green, and the performances from Cotton and Welles... It's a classic of British cinema!	2
6109	House of the Dead	Uwe Boll = automatic zero	0
6110	The Bourne Supremacy	Convincingly choreographed action sequences were all the movie had to offer, in my mind.  I was a fan of the first one, but this is one of those sort of bland sequels that doesn't do much to capture my interest.	1
6111	Gladiator	A powerful touching well made film. Interesting through out and the acting was solid. Sad.	2
6112	Gladiator	You sold me queer giraffes. That line alone puts it up to atleast 80.	1
6113	Zeitgeist: The Movie	Yalcin Kucuk'e cektirmisler filmi.	1
6114	Finding Dory	"Love Makes Everything Perfect
The highlights of this movie are not the colorful underwater world and the various funny and cute marine animals, but the love that is reflected from the story. 
http://www.toyswill.com/new-in-finding-dory-crush-stuffed-animals-40cm-p-6846.html"	2
6115	The Last Song	May I just say that I hate Miley Cyrus, but for once she was actually good at acting! Sure, she could have been improvised for with someone else, but I thought she fit the character well. I loved the story and the lines, and as usual in a Nicholas Spark's film, it was a tear-jerker.	2
6116	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	"A.I awsome indeed
"	1
6117	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Good stuff -- a bit of a retreat of Episode 4, plot wise, but a very welcome return to classic sci fi after the lamentable, forgettable prequels. 	2
6118	Formula 51	This movie was terrible.  The only reason you would want to see it is to see Sam Jackson in a kilt.  Do not see this movie, and if someone drags you to it close your eyes.  The plot is awful and the acting just as bad.  I love Sam Jackson but he is no good in this film.  I think he needs to pick and choose his movies a little better.  Do not see, I cannot stress this enough.	0
6119	Inception	The acting is insane and the story line is unique and original. 	2
6120	Salt	what a waste of money, I spent most of the time worrying about how much popcorn I had left... come to think about it, I should have just bought a couple more buckets instead	0
6121	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Johnny Depp as always the best actor.. he prove it in this film.	2
6122	The Prestige	IMO, One of the best Nolan's movies. Incredible script and final. Must to watch.	2
6123	Bonnie and Clyde	Love it!	2
6124	The Dark Knight	this was a good movie... i watched it 3 times. but the face kinda freaked me out lol	2
6125	Armitage III: Poly Matrix	Cyberpunk anime about identity, prejudice and badass robots.	1
6126	Wild Tales	I wish more movies would be like this one. I won`t loose too many words on this one only watch it ! Watch it ! It is an epic movie.	0
6127	Russian Ark	Beautiful. I was honestly somewhat underwhelmed until the ending. The end of the ball, the departure of 'The European', the long procession to the exit, all so sad.	1
6128	Heat	Pointless subplots, niggas.	0
6129	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Would have been one of the best sci-fi's if the ending wasn't there. It just breaks everything about the movie.	0
6130	Forrest Gump	"one of the most unsettling and dangerous films ever made. 
its idolization of ignorance is a triumph for the dull, the stupid
and the ignorant. movies like this ruin america

6131	Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne	Ladies of the Park!?!?? Please can we not have the original title listed; that's just awful.  A great film, by the way, some 30 years ahead of its time.	2
6132	The Silent Partner	Canadian cinema at its best. Does not pull any punches or pretend to be anything other than it is. Convincing performances all around.	0
6133	The Notebook	it really makes me cry sad but realictic story	1
6134	Back to the Future	The BEST film EVER!	2
6135	Inception	"I think the matrix has stronger story than the Inception.
But notice the last sence,"	1
6136	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	n/a. 100. seriously.	1
6137	Total Recall	Couldn't even finish this atrocity. TERRIBLE GARBAGE. It was a celluloid bimbo. Really pretty, but dumb as hell. 	0
6138	Die Hard	Boring. Too much suspense leads to boredom.	0
6139	Last Action Hero	I saw this like 10 times and I can't remember a single thing about it. Not one thing. I can imaging a car on a road. But is that just from this picture? maybe	1
6140	Let the Right One In	Cool cinematography. Ginger Snaps does a better job with essentially the same story.	1
6141	Army of Shadows	The only way to be young and get to Melville is through Criterion, and thier first releases from the master captured my attention within minutes, but this is on an entirely differnt level.  Before working with Alain Delon, Melville worked with ensemble casts, and his small pack of Resistance agents are all compelling, and fully realized through silence as much as dialog.  Technically outstanding, artistically perfect.    	2
6142	Gladiator	super super super	1
6143	A Quiet Place	Really well made, original story. Creative, well-acted, incredible use of sound and a remarkably rich story with little dialoge. What's not to like?	2
6144	Fleabag	I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning. I want someone to tell me what to eat, what to like, what to hate, what to rage about, what to listen to, what band to like, what to buy tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about. I want someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, and who to love, and how to tell them. I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life.	0
6145	Eraserhead	Not nearly as grotesque or nightmarish as its reputation promised, Lynch's Eraserhead is a surprisingly humorous and beautiful story of a man and the horror he has born.  Starring Jack Nance('s eyebrows).	2
6146	The Exorcist III	Borders on camp at several critical moments but I still love this fucking movie. Probably because of Brad Dourif doing his usual creepy-angry bit and George C. Scott bringing his angry grandpa rage.	2
6147	Inside	testing	1
6148	The Rules of Attraction	Has been my favorite movie for a long time. I knew James van der beek only from dawson's creek and he blew my mind in this movie. It's a shame he never did anything as good or memmorable after this one. I still hope he will.  Beautifully shot, great acting, amazing soundtrack!	2
6149	Gladiator	Awesome but I'm not too sure I can watch it repeatedly 	0
6150	Hot Tub Time Machine	Sometimes funny, but at other times flat. It relies too much on boobs and off colour juvenile jokes. There are so many gay, aids, rape and women jokes I can handle. 	0
6151	Cloverfield	It should be a 30 minute short-film.  The handy-cam shooting is interesting for about the first 20 minutes, then it just wears on you.  Unless you feel really compelled to see this movie, find something better to watch.	0
6152	World Trade Center	disgustingly disrespectful	1
6153	Leviathan	Cold to the last breath. A painfull swallow of Vodka. 	0
6154	Blue Valentine	Very strong movie, great performances and intelligent script. I love it. Ryan Goslin is so great in the row. 	2
6155	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	A masterpiece of art-direction, cinematography, casting and storytelling. Often overlooked in any discussion of the best film in the trilogy because of RotK, I'd put it right at the top. In fact so far it is the only film I've seen to be given the perfect 100. 	2
6156	Alien	An almost perfect movie. Great villain, great mystery, masterfully executed.	2
6157	Fast Five	A guilty pleasure involving explosions, heists, car chases, and a surprising amount of character payoff. The only real problem I have is the fight between Rock and Diesel. Buuuuuuullllllshhhhhiiiiiiiit.	2
6158	Noah	By far the worst Aronofsky/Mansell Collaboration.  Plot was not great but it was partially redeemed by some scenes with gorgeous visuals (The creation story comes to mind.	2
6159	Wendy and Lucy	A modern day Umberto D that works very well and is driven by a wonderful performance from Michelle Williams. 	2
6160	Sucker Punch	C'mon son, it's a satire! The Funny Games of badass grrl action movies.  It takes the zombies, robots, kitanas, and exploitative misogyny nerds clamor for and rubs their noses in it.	2
6161	The Cat in the Hat	This movie was SHIT 	1
6162	The Room	Any movie this gloriously bad has to be cherished for generations. 	2
6163	May	awesome	2
6164	Harry Brown	A terrible, unpleasant mess of a film. 	0
6165	Flight of the Navigator	"LOVED it. 
Though I was 11 when I saw it, 20-odd years ago."	2
6166	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Quick humor, only scenes essential to character and plot progression, and really interesting direction. Your typical Edgar Wright movie - but when you add in humor for geeks and some real commitment to the comic-y roles, you get a really awesome movie.	2
6167	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Very well done and interesting to watch when you're a child..	2
6168	The Sound of Music	More like The Sound of Muzak if you ask me.	1
6169	The Room	Tommy Wiseau is a genius	2
6170	No Country for Old Men	One of the greatest adventure films of all time. The Coen's rare blend of adaptation and creativity make the McCarthy story jump to life on the screen. Probably one of the best performances by an entire cast in the last twenty years or so. Bardem's villian was simply a masterpiece. 	2
6171	Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children	Quite an enjoyable film with a great imaginary world and characters inside. see. Hail Eva Green!	2
6172	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Old movies good movies.	2
6173	Gerry	 I gave this a 2 simply because of the dirt pillow conversation.  Other than that it was the most boring movie I have ever seen, too bad they couldn't have made better use of really good camera work.	0
6174	The Silence of the Lambs	One of the best movies ever made. If you like thriller it is a must see movie.	2
6175	Watchmen	watchmen is the great science-fiction and social psychology movie, for last years its the effective one of a few films for me.	2
6176	Logan	Overlong, overly violent and overrated.	0
6177	Glory	Interesting topic (even for european) with comic-book characters that ruin the effort of drama.	2
6178	Water	A wonderful satire.	2
6179	The Matrix	I was amazed as I saw it the first time the spring of 1999... not sure if it would bring about the same effect 10 years later	1
6180	Ms .45	the saddest thing about this movie was the way it was like a crippled cowhand on a dude ranch for idiots: it kept on straddling the fence of enjoyability, only to fall off time after time, and drunkenly drag itself back on. I imagine that if there had been production values attached to this affair, and it weren't approached in post-production like some filthy 1970s porno, it might've been a good companion film to Taxi Driver. Not so, however. 	0
6181	Something Borrowed	Something awful.	0
6182	2 Coelhos	indiezzzzzzz	1
6183	Hereditary	nice acting terrible script	2
6184	Wreck-It Ralph	It wasn't the Roger-Rabbit-with-videogames that I was expecting, but it's still a solid movie. I recommend it.	2
6185	Edge of Tomorrow	Really entertaining. A reasonable plot supported by a strong cast and characters, spot-on humor and great editing.	2
6186	High Tension	The first 3/4 of the movie would be an 85, unfortunately the ending was only worth a 45, so I split the difference	0
6187	Crank: High Voltage	No, this isn't a flawless movie... It will never be remembered as a good movie. It'll be remembered as one of the most entertaining movies ever made. I have watched this over a dozen times and love it every time... I consider it more of a comedy than a true action flick. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.	2
6188	2019 - After the Fall of New York	What can you say. An early mix between Children of Men and Escape from New York.  After the atomic wars has ruined most of the planet and left women sterile. Mankind lives like out-laws in a Mad Max kinda world. When the rumor starts to spread that there is a fertile woman hidden somewhere in New York. Our hero sets out to find her.  This movie has no merits at all. The sound-effects, special-effects, acting, dialouge, make up and everything else is really low quiality.  Somehow though, this fil	1
6189	Cloud Atlas	Favorite movie	2
6190	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Nice effects, great jokes, but it is TOO long. This is one of them movies that would gain a lot by being a hour shorter.	1
6191	Double Team	possibly the most hilarious ending to any film i have ever seen	2
6192	Léon: The Professional	Let the 100 rating talk instead of me. Just BRAVO. My favorite movie. 	0
6193	The Matrix	What can I say...This is a benchmark to all action movies of all times. Great attention to details, excellent music and sound. Stylish idea. Simply the best action movie.	2
6194	The Ten Commandments	A classic telling of a timeless story, with watermark-setting performances.	2
6195	Ben	This was one of my favorites as a child.  I felt bad for the kid and his rats.  Isn't that weird..LOL.	0
6196	Dr. No	The first and one of the best.	2
6197	Breaker! Breaker!	This film is one of the movies where you just wonder who thought it was a good idea.  Also, I seriously think the inspiration for this movie was hey, this movie studio just got done filming a movie at this western set.  Let's write a movie where we can wind up destroying it.  Plus, it can't make up it's mind what it wants to be.  It's like one writer wanted a serious movie based on mysticism and martial arts, another wanted a western/pioneer movie, another wanted a trucker movie, another	0
6198	RoboCop 3	One Word: Why?	1
6199	The Matrix	there hasn't been a movie since that has really given me such a broad spectrum of intellectual, visual, emotional, and even spiritual entertainment all in one package.. honestly forever a classic. 	2
6200	Serial Mom	Fucking amazing. Especially the pussy willows.	2
6201	Inside Man	Horrible music, interesting story	0
6202	Raiders of the Lost Ark	Fantastic Harrison Ford in a great action adventure film	2
6203	Sin City	The misogyny in Frank Miller's stuff is so over the top it's almost campy, but this movie was such a revelation visually that it deserves respect. It was truly a comic book come to life. 300 is trash, though.	1
6204	The Room	O HAI DENNY	1
6205	Certified Copy	Good. Scenario, Directing, Acting, Camerawork. We r all same and interchangeable.	2
6206	Searching	Excellent storytelling. Glad it chose to forego the routes of gross voyeurism and the big bad Internet cautionary tale, ones I've come to dread when thrillers employ tech/social media as a lens.	2
6207	Requiem for a Dream	Overrated	1
6208	Shotgun Stories	A little slow at the beginning but builds the suspense nicely and I appreciated the realism. Well worth a look.	2
6209	X-Men: Days of Future Past	I loved the use of time travel in this narrative - first time I saw it used in this way. Movie was a fun ride. 	2
6210	Leviathan	Cold to the last breath. A painfull swallow of Vodka. 	0
6211	Blue Valentine	Very strong movie, great performances and intelligent script. I love it. Ryan Goslin is so great in the row. 	2
6212	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	A masterpiece of art-direction, cinematography, casting and storytelling. Often overlooked in any discussion of the best film in the trilogy because of RotK, I'd put it right at the top. In fact so far it is the only film I've seen to be given the perfect 100. 	2
6213	Alien	An almost perfect movie. Great villain, great mystery, masterfully executed.	2
6214	Fast Five	A guilty pleasure involving explosions, heists, car chases, and a surprising amount of character payoff. The only real problem I have is the fight between Rock and Diesel. Buuuuuuullllllshhhhhiiiiiiiit.	2

6216	Wendy and Lucy	A modern day Umberto D that works very well and is driven by a wonderful performance from Michelle Williams. 	2
6217	Mad Max: Fury Road	I really don't see what's good in this movie, besides the fact that it actually makes fun of serious action movies with its '80s tone and ridiculous characters. The figure of Max is rendered completely useless, while the whole story is just lame. The best thing are the thugs, lots of fun	1
6218	He Was a Quiet Man	Despite it's multiple flaws, He Was a Quiet Man is a great flick. The plot twist was completely unexpected.	2
6219	The Prestige	Best movie ever	2
6220	Warrior	Awesome movie :) and Hardy :)))))))) 	2
6221	The A-Team	Action, action, action. No story. Couldn't stay focused.	0
6222	The Road	very bleak. i feel like the first 1/3 of the movie holds up, but then it wavers after that. this movie should've been cast with all unknowns (though vigo worked)--it's the darkest of dark, the apocalypse, and then hey, whaddaya know, it's robert duvall, omar from the wire, and alma garrett (best two tv shows ever, btw). similarly, the product placement was so completely out of place. lame. plus, find a skinny kid. chubby cheeked cherubs don't belong in the wastelands.	2
6223	Bride of Frankenstein	probally the greatest sequal ever made in the horror genre & a true classic, if you claim to be a big horror fan & havent seen this then you are a beginner!	2
6224	Starship Troopers	Would've been much better if they hadn't attached the name of a good book to this tripe.	0
6225	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Classic story. One of my must won movies. Spring for the extended edition 4 disc set.	2
6226	Black Hawk Down	Propaganda	0
6227	The Matrix	One of the best movies ever!	2
6228	Guardians of the Galaxy	A fantastic comic book film. Likely my favourite Marvel movie, and only outdone by the Dark Knight movies. All of the Guardians are quite likable, especially Rocket and Groot. For somebody who is well known as a WWE superstar, Dave Bautista did a fine job portraying Drax the Destroy. I was surprised to see Michael Rooker and Lee Pace; it was a pleasant surprise. I am looking forward to the sequel which is three long years away. 	2
6229	The Outsiders	I loved this movie when i was younger. The perfect 80's movie with a good cast.	2
6230	No Country for Old Men	Cohen does it as always	1
6231	Stealing Beauty	Such a beautiful film - and a great sound track.	2
6232	The Tree of Life	Simply the best movie I have ever seen	2
6233	Dirty Dancing	Best dance-movie ever.	2
6234	Captain America: The First Avenger	Dry, boring, paint-by-numbers.	0
6235	Gerry	It's like a German Expressionist film, without the German, or the Expressionism. One of the most painful movie-going experiences of my life.  I recall leaning over to my friend during the extended driving scene at the beginning, whispering, Wouldn't it be awful if the whole movie were like this? And so it was. I dunno. Maybe if I'd been warned beforehand how it would be I might have appreciated it more, but with an Oscar-winning screenwriter participating, I expected something different. 	2
6236	Let the Right One In	Quite possibly one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, and greatly contributes to its overall dark mood. I'm very curious as to see what the North American version is going to be like, but I highly doubt it will be as good.	2
6237	Harold and Maude	When I first saw Harold and Maude, I fell in love with it. Quirky and brilliant!	2
6238	Xew Xew	Masterpiece 	2
6239	Bang, Bang, You're Dead	Good Foster performance but overall rather average film.	2
6240	Cats	The music was good, but I had no idea what was happening most of the time.	0
6241	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	Making his debut as a director, W.D. Rick Richter doesn't bring out the baroque lunacy of the material-a kind of fermented parody of M*A*S*H, STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and the TV series The A-Team-but though the characters don't develop and the laughs don't build or come together, the film's uninflected deadpan tone is somehow likable.	0
6242	Transformers	An atrocious advertisement.	0
6243	Die Hard	Yes was very predictable, much like all movies of this genre, which did spoil it a bit, but is 100% a Christmas movie that I would watch over and over again every year. Is Die Hard with a Vengeance set on Christmas Day? 	0
6244	Ghost	The hell-ghosts were unnecessary, but otherwise a decent story.	0
6245	The Shining	Zamanè sinemasının balonlarından sadece biri. 	1
6246	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo	A brilliantly directed, beautyfully shot and surprisingly bold adaptation of a popular pulp classic.	2
6247	The Big Lebowski	i really don't want you anywhere near me if you genuinely don't like this movie.	1
6248	Street Fighter	hilariously funny  xD     You got....paid ?	2
6249	Lost in Translation	Hard to sit through, honestly, but very well-acted.	2
6250	The Prestige	second best movie for me!	2
6251	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	What needs to be said about this movie has already been explained. Both uplifting and depressing, an emotional ride. 	0
6252	Fight Club	Just perfect	2
6253	The Blues Brothers	A classic dark comedy. Sit back and watch it unfold.	2
6254	Fast Five	"Loved the action/fight scenes. The races were pretty good. Pretty entertaining, especially Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson.

The only thing I found disappointing was the budding crush between Dom and a female officer (too easy). Minus that, this is good for a guy's night out."	2
6255	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	trash.	0
6256	Blade Runner 2049	Overly dark and dramatic, low on story line.	0
6257	Marley & Me	Treacle. And that's just the part before the dog dies.	0
6258	Dog Day Afternoon	While it starts out as a fairly light black comedy, Dog Day Afternoon quickly spirals into gripping suspense.	2
6259	Reis	P.S not watched.	1
6260	Lost in Translation	White Whine: The Movie.	1
6261	Cloud Atlas	So bad	0
6262	Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol	Tom Cruise gets smashed a lot.	1
6263	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	this is a great series with wonderful cast and great special effects.	2
6264	Hostel	utter crap- why is Tarantino considered a genius?	0
6265	Buffalo Soldiers	Funny and dark.	2
6266	I Heart Huckabees	A bizarre film, I Heart Huckabees struggles between satirical deadpan and wacky romp, and would have been better had it commited to either. The movie works rides on the strength of it's cast (especially dustin hoffman) and a few truly funny scenes, but the comic timing is far off and the movie often seems as unsure as it's characters. The novelty of play with philosophy concepts like dolls also sets it apart, but the ending chooses to err toward comedy and ends with a chuckle and a thud.	2
6267	Zombieland	prolly the only movie with zombies that i enjoyed so much :)	0
6268	The Blues Brothers	One of my favorites!  I love Belushi and Akroyd.  Hands down this movie is one of the funniest I've seen.  Rocking soundtrack as well.	2
6269	Constantine	Um bom entretenimento, um boa produção e efeitos especiais... porém, não passa disso.	1
6270	City of God	The Young and the Damned (1950)   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042804/	0
6271	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	One of the best!  The heart of what makes movies scary.	2
6272	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	The best sequel ever made. 	2
6273	Vampire's Kiss	Possibly one of the greatest performances ever crafted by the insanely brilliant Nicolas Cage.	2
6274	Kin-Dza-Dza	Just another barely-there-commentary wrapped in a dull pseudo-scifi movie.	0
6275	Lost Highway	WwWwWwoOoOoOoOwWwWwW	1
6276	Kingdom of Heaven	95/100 for the Director's Cut, the original cut gets a 70/100 for me.	1
6277	Krisha	so so good!	2
6278	Naisu no mori: The First Contact	No idea what I just saw. A bit tedious at times, but the sheer absurdity made up for it.	0
6279	Juno	A brilliant, heartfelt teen comedy, with some important messages, great performances and a fantastic soundtrack	2
6280	Ford v Ferrari	Cinemaximum / Akasya	1
6281	Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets	Gorgeous production meets horrible acting and unlikable leads. A disaster.	0
6282	Speed 2: Cruise Control	THIS IS LIKE SPEED 2 BUT WITH A BUS INSTEAD OF A BOAT	0
6283	Joker	amazing movie incredible acting	2
6284	Warcraft	The story was nice and the characters were amazing, could have been much better but it was really worth watching	2
6285	Nocturnal Animals	great movie best thing i watched this year.	2
6286	Goodfellas	I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen this movie and will surely see it again and again in the future.  Incredible cast, witty narration, and the mixture of cold-hearted violence and clever humor is unbeatable.  	2
6287	Noah	If they would not have associated it to the Biblical story it would have been a better movie.	0
6288	The Cat in the Hat	what the fuck	1
6289	Trainspotting	Trainspotting is a milestone in independent filming as it reached to millions with a subject not so comforting yet so powerful. 	2
6290	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Good stuff -- a bit of a retreat of Episode 4, plot wise, but a very welcome return to classic sci fi after the lamentable, forgettable prequels. 	2
6291	Formula 51	This movie was terrible.  The only reason you would want to see it is to see Sam Jackson in a kilt.  Do not see this movie, and if someone drags you to it close your eyes.  The plot is awful and the acting just as bad.  I love Sam Jackson but he is no good in this film.  I think he needs to pick and choose his movies a little better.  Do not see, I cannot stress this enough.	0
6292	Inception	The acting is insane and the story line is unique and original. 	2
6293	The Godfather: Part II	The presence of Robert de Niro as young Vito is awesome. Probably the best movie continuation.	2
6294	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Good action movie, fun to watch and moves along quick enough after the first half.	2
6295	Beethoven	-	1
6296	Sharknado	Where was Aquaman?	1
6297	Inception	this is the best  Drama, Sci-fi, Suspense/Thriller, Mystery movie I think	2
6298	Drive	stylish drivel	1
6299	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	film was perfect nevertheless it's slightly different than original novel. 	2
6300	Koyaanisqatsi	Incredible.  There is something incredible about almost every shot in this film.  Combined with the relentless Philip Glass soundtrack, it really is an experience.  I don't find the film's 'message' overly preachy or even particularly pointed as some have complained, I think there are a multitude of positive and negative takeaways about humanity here.  I do feel that it begins to drag a bit after The Grid sequence and does not return to full steam until the final shot, so not a perfect score.	0
6301	Southland Tales	How do you rate this? This is probably the most baffling movie I've ever seen. Hated it, wanted to love it, sort of did at times, laughed a lot, rolled my eyes a lot. After it was over, I was sort of fascinated but couldn't call it a successful movie. 	0
6302	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	The ultimate existential horror film. Filmed with the kind of low-budget atmosphere that can't be bought, yet endlessly inventive. And the best cast of baddies ever.	2
6303	Akira	Original.	2
6304	Desperately Seeking Susan	Personally my favorite movie and probably the best work of Susan Sildeman. Enjoyable story with a big look at fashion of 1980s. Madonna's performance doesn't suck either. Oh where is the magical time of cheesy 80s.	2
6305	Battle Royale	A brilliant dystopian movie. 	2
6306	Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	Flash Gordon rides again, but with timing so right, it became a phenemon and still is. It really doesn't get any better than this. A strong condender for the greatest film of my lifetime. I can watch it in whatever version and never get bored of it. The original trilogy still rules!	1
6307	The Notebook	I LOVED IT	2
6308	Devil in the Flesh	nice actress...the rest is a mess	0
6309	Layer Cake	Very clever, but the ending really bummed me out...Although it did add to the over all effect of the movie	1
6310	Jungle 2 Jungle	A businessman (Allen) learns of an illegitimate son who has been raised in a jungle tribe. Named Mimi-Siku (\Cat pee\), the boy tries to win the heart of his busy father on a trip to that OTHER jungle, New York City.	1
6311	Jason X	This was, oddly, not as terrible as I expected	1
6312	Terminator Genisys	T-800 is a real boy!	1
6313	There Will Be Blood	"Top Film at the lolo Awards 2007
 
 Won 7 Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Editing and Best Original Score. Also Nominee for Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing."	2
6314	Interstellar	A wonderful tale of love and hope. Nolan successfully manages to conceal the film's flaws.	2
6315	AVP: Alien vs. Predator	It sucks!	0
6316	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	scored purely for how i liked it at age 12, no idea what i'd give after a watch now	2
6317	Hot Tub Time Machine	Sometimes funny, but at other times flat. It relies too much on boobs and off colour juvenile jokes. There are so many gay, aids, rape and women jokes I can handle. 	0
6318	Cloverfield	It should be a 30 minute short-film.  The handy-cam shooting is interesting for about the first 20 minutes, then it just wears on you.  Unless you feel really compelled to see this movie, find something better to watch.	0
6319	World Trade Center	disgustingly disrespectful	1
6320	Gravity	70 is for the sake of the mesmerizing visual.i was expecting to feel much more independent soul while i was being hypnotized by such brillant effcets but i just couldnt.Specifically the dream scene is nothing more than a typical dontloseyourhope lesson and it seemed very insincere to me.I think main stream is never gonna give up to give me life lessons in a know-it-all manner!!!	0
6321	The Shawshank Redemption	an excellent, toucing dramatic film.	2
6322	Community	Season 1: 80, Season 2: 80, Season 3: 70, Season 4: 65, Season 5: 55, Season 6: 85	1
6323	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	"up until a certain point..its on its way to 100...then the movie doesn't end (sadly) and last 45 min (it feels like HOURS) goes on & on & on......
"	0
6324	Revolver	If you're looking for a movie to just pass time and entertain yourself with no exhaustion, then that movie isn't for ya, That movie has the potential to change the way you think forever, it took me 3 times to decipher the code, yeah and the third time i had a pen and a paper to write the quote and the ideas of the movie, it's a brilliant movie it's just not ordinary that' why it's very underrated. 	2
6325	The Fifth Element	beautifull space opera. 	1
6326	Pleasantville	Amazing premise, wonderfully executed.	2
6327	Taxi Driver	DeNiro awesome, suspense is tight. Own it love it.	2
6328	Glory	Overly PC	0
6329	Sahara	Good Movie	2
6330	May	awesome	2
6331	Harry Brown	A terrible, unpleasant mess of a film. 	0
6332	Flight of the Navigator	"LOVED it. 
Though I was 11 when I saw it, 20-odd years ago."	2
6333	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Quick humor, only scenes essential to character and plot progression, and really interesting direction. Your typical Edgar Wright movie - but when you add in humor for geeks and some real commitment to the comic-y roles, you get a really awesome movie.	2
6334	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Very well done and interesting to watch when you're a child..	2
6335	The Sound of Music	More like The Sound of Muzak if you ask me.	1
6336	The Room	Tommy Wiseau is a genius	2
6337	Bride Wars	kinda silly, but very pink, girlish and sweet.  if you're not in right mood, this can be really annoying actually.	0
6338	Brooklyn	The feels...	1
6339	Les Misérables	I must be the only person who thinks Hugh Jackman can't sing... but he's the reason I couldn't love this film as much I'd have liked to.	0
6340	Cellular	Boring crap.	0
6341	Brazil: A Report on Torture	Na íntegra aqui:   http://www.linktv.org/video/3959/brazil-a-report-on-torture	0
6342	The Lobster	Sátira sobre a obrigatoriedade, dissimulação e a inveja dos relacionamentos afetivos.	1
6343	The Matrix	It's definitely a powerful mark, that divides cinematographic history.	2
6344	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	nice	2
6345	The Fountain	A work of art, deeply emotional and highly sophisticated. It will be easier to follow some details and  the  flow of the storyline for those with some familiarity with buddhists concepts, even though it's not a requirement.Nonetheless, it's a breathtaking experience. 	2
6346	Get Smart	Yes, it's a little different from the original TV series, but it's a great movie nonetheless, with all the classic Get Smart humour and awkwardness. Everything you'd expect from a spy movie spoof! And Anne Hathaway was gorgeous and very sexy as 99, she got the old “Oh, Max!” just right.	2
6347	Home Alone 2: Lost in New York	Loved the movie. Great for the kids.	2
6348	Treasure Planet	had the potential to be a great movie, but was just so badly executed.	0
6349	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	One of Nicholson's best. Such heart warming characters; if we leave out Nurse Ratchet. The trip to the City is such a treat.  	2
6350	G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra	It's terrible, but kind of cool in a nostalgic way.	2
6351	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	revenge of the suck.	0
6352	Shaun of the Dead	It just so funny.	2
6353	The Dark Crystal	Lots of people like this one less than I do, but this is a great movie. I did see it as a ten year old and that (I am guessing) helped it cement into my brain, but still, a good movie for young and old. 	2
6354	Texas Chainsaw 3D	So many unnecessary cuts 	0
6355	Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End	Hated the ending, but it was well done.	0
6356	Waking Life	great movie but requires a great attention span.	1
6357	Koyaanisqatsi	Incredible.  There is something incredible about almost every shot in this film.  Combined with the relentless Philip Glass soundtrack, it really is an experience.

6359	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	The ultimate existential horror film. Filmed with the kind of low-budget atmosphere that can't be bought, yet endlessly inventive. And the best cast of baddies ever.	2
6360	Legion	Did somebody mistype this as horror/action? Because I'm pretty certain this was the funniest movie of 2010. Too many great lines to quote like Tyrese explaining the old woman climbinb on the ceiling with baby teeth. Classic. I give it a 1 for the talent it took the people who made this film to lie to someone enough to give them the chance to make this horrendous movie.	2
6361	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Would have gotten a higher score if it wasn't for Keira Knightly.	0
6362	The Birds	outstanding!	2
6363	Serenity	Unorthodox and amazing movie that introduced me to the greatest sci-fi tv series ever - Firefly (albeit a little late like most Firefly fans).	2
6364	Lawrence of Arabia	One of the very best films of all time.  Brilliant acting, directing and cinematography.  The genius combination of Peter O'Toole and David Lean can't be beat.  A must see film for everyone.	2
6365	The Air I Breathe	If you really wish Hollywood did better movies, than this movie is really it. 	0
6366	Bandidas	Reasonable movie. Has some humour and action. Even a pretty good storyline behind it. All-in-all nice to watch. The movie is about a rich girl and a poor girl, that ultimately join in the fight against wrong in the wild west.  	2
6367	The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	The Greatest Western Film Ever, and a perfect movie by any standard.	2
6368	Catwoman	I'd rather eat cat poo with a nitting needle than watch this again...	0
6369	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	hahahahahhahahahaha	1
6370	Casino	Very good!	2
6371	The Godfather	Don Corleone losses his elder son and is attacked by rival gang...in this condition, his other son takes the charge and comes in command.he starts punishing the people who killed his brother and attacked his father. With the course of time, he becomes 'The Godfather'	2
6372	Tropic Thunder	If you've ever worked in theater, you will totally know all of these characters! This movie was hilarious, and really a joy to watch. I won't say Oscars, but it was a really good time at the cinema. 	2
6373	Farewell, My Queen	More of a fascinating study of obsession than a detailed examination of the fall of Marie Antoinette. Great performances, and quietly rapturous. 	2
6374	Happy Feet	Entirely too long and too politically conscious.	0
6375	The Scorpion King	OK ***	1
6376	Christmas Vacation	It didn't age well and Chevy Chase is a dick.	1
6377	The Notebook	Absolutely beautiful film - intriguing story pulls you right in!	2
6378	Alien	Sigourney Weaver... hellyeah, HR Giger, Hellyeah.... my arse was kicked by this film, and still manages to do so now.	1
6379	Contact	"better to be watched or re-watched after reading carl sagan's novel, demon haunted world.
"	1
6380	Memento	really liked this film a lot. a film you must watch more than once. great cast and direction by chris nolan. 	2
6381	Star Trek: The Motion Picture	There are parts of this film I absolutely love, but for the most part is it an extremely slow moving exposition on the exterior of space ships. If you ever need footage of the original Enterprise, this is the film to queue up.	0
6382	The Shawshank Redemption	Unoriginal and overly sentimental.	0
6383	Halloween: Resurrection	The worst one 	0
6384	Donnie Darko	A creatively cryptic fantasy drama - Donnie Darko bends the mind as much as it does space time... This is an absolutely MUST SEE movie that is like soul-food for the imagination.	2
6385	The Cowboys	Good Old Western wiht John Wayne	1
6386	Weird Science	Nostalgia glasses on: Really good movie, the boy in me liked all the computer stuff.  It was stunning witnessing what they could do at that time, connect to servers and download everything!...  It's really a non-stop nerdgasm from start to finish.  Reality glasses on:  Take it as a fairy tale set in an 80's world.  Some people wins, some peoples looses, you learn something and Robert Downey Jr is in there too.  You'll love it!	2
6387	Twilight	absolutly amazing i was waiting for this movie for so long and i loved the best movie i thinki have ever seen!!	2
6388	Street Fighter	This  movie is sooooooooo bad... it's awesomely good. It has bad acting, a bad plot, and a very bad Van Damme. How he pass as an American in any of his movies is beyond me. An excellent movie for a cheesy movie night.	0
6389	The Dark Knight	It always amazed me how overrated this movie had become. Having first saw it in the theater while on a trip to Kentucky I accepted it as a good popcorn flick, but did not think so highly of it as others have come to. There is nothing really special about this movie, the story is decent but everything else is bland and boring save for the amazing acting.	2
6390	Cyrus	Memorable for being a romantic comedy about codependency. 	2
6391	Equilibrium	this movie has the worst story line in the world! The action is just plain dumb period! Do you think doing a flip when 50 guys with machine guns are shooting at you is going to stop them from hitting you?? the people who mad this movie do!	0
6392	Mad Max: Fury Road	classic	2
6393	The Sound of Music	Still one of my favourite musical movies.	0
6394	The Lego Batman Movie	izlediğim en iyi batman filmi.	2
6395	Jason Bourne		1
6396	La La Land	The most artistic fun movie I've ever seen. It just couldn't be better	1
6397	Drive	most boring and overrated movie  I've ever seen.	0
6398	Shin Godzilla	The first Godzilla film in 12 years, and that's about the time I've waited for this one. I was happy to see it in Japan when it came out, and a childhood dream came true. It's the most terrifying, adult Godzilla until now, I couldn't have wished for more than that.	2
6399	A Dog's Purpose	For a cute movie about dogs there's a lot of dog death in here.	1
6400	Curse of the Golden Flower	Beautiful imagery, but sub-par plot and pacing.	2
6401	Red River	The original Brokeback Mountain!	1
6402	Waking Life	The crowning jewel in Linklater's portfolio of sub-art school trash. Looks interesting, but the monologues are mindnumbing and the overall tone is unrelentingly obnoxious.	0
6403	Children of Men	An all-time favorite.	2
6404	Repo! The Genetic Opera	I really loved this film, start to finish.  Lots of names I had never heard of before and a few that I recognized (Alexa Vega got super hot; look up Machete Kills).  Every character had numerous flaws save for Shiloh, and there was a variety of musical numbers; Pat Benatar even makes an appearance.  The story ends in tragedy, but it is a great one.  Love, anger, deceit, vengeance, gore, humor and Zydrate!!!  Zydrate comes in a little glass vial!	0
6405	The Descendants	"Clooney has received great reviews, but the actress who played the older daughter stole the show. Enjoyed it, but expected more, given the raves I've read. 

Bring tissues..."	2
6406	House of the Dead	Haha	1
6407	Se7en	What could go wrong in a crime thriller starring Morgan Freeman AND Brad Pitt revolving around the seven deadly sins? Apparently, both nothing and everything. This movie should not be viewed casually.  I would also not suggest eating while watching this movie, as some scenes are rather raw. A must-watch for fans of either actor, it is also a great serial-killer-based mystery thriller.	2
6408	The Silence of the Lambs	shhhh	1
6409	Norsemen	Really not a fan of fecal related humour, I shut it off as soon as it got to that part. The other humour up until then was mediocre at best anyway.[	1
6410	Melancholia	"TITS
"	1
6411	Mad Max: Fury Road	Very fun movie, don't expect any type of story. 	2
6412	District 9	good	2
6413	Se7en	great!	2
6414	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom	Brilliant film! One for all the family to enjoy.	2
6415	Cocaine Cowboys	Very informative. Over all the film gives a very concise overview how the drugbarons took control over Miami and literally built the place. Then they started fighting between each other and hell broke loose. The action is hard packed. Huge editing and short clips. In the same minute you can hear several persons speaking. Often this technique bothered me - especially in the beginning - and didn't work very well but it helped keep the pace going which also suited the film very well.	2
6416	The House of the Devil	More style than substance, Ti West crafts an effective thriller in the vein of Dario Argento and his giallo horror contemporaries. Well acted, well shot, and, interestingly enough, very much a 1980s period piece. Worth seeing in the theater or via Amazon.com's rental service.	2
6417	The War of the Worlds	ridiculous and poor acting	0
6418	Heat	Nothing short of GENIUS!!	1
6419	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom	the best one from the trilogy. ( not including the latest one)	2
6420	Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens	Good stuff -- a bit of a retreat of Episode 4, plot wise, but a very welcome return to classic sci fi after the lamentable, forgettable prequels. 	2
6421	Formula 51	This movie was terrible.  The only reason you would want to see it is to see Sam Jackson in a kilt.  Do not see this movie, and if someone drags you to it close your eyes.  The plot is awful and the acting just as bad.  I love Sam Jackson but he is no good in this film.  I think he needs to pick and choose his movies a little better.  Do not see, I cannot stress this enough.	0

6423	The Godfather: Part II	The presence of Robert de Niro as young Vito is awesome. Probably the best movie continuation.	2
6424	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Good action movie, fun to watch and moves along quick enough after the first half.	2
6425	Beethoven	-	1
6426	Sharknado	Where was Aquaman?	1
6427	Inception	this is the best  Drama, Sci-fi, Suspense/Thriller, Mystery movie I think	2
6428	Drive	stylish drivel	1
6429	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	film was perfect nevertheless it's slightly different than original novel. 	2
6430	Jack and Jill	I will never know why adam sandler keeps making such terrible movies and how al pacino agreed to play in this one.	0
6431	Pulp Fiction	masterpiece	2
6432	Children of Men	Absolutely stunning, probably my favorite film.	2
6433	Cloverfield	One of the best thrillers I've ever seen.	2
6434	Battle: Los Angeles	Ugh, painful. The only character trait that any of them had was good/tough guy and the plot was . . . there wasn't a plot. No plot, no characters, only big explosions. Please, don't watch this.	0
6435	Drive	More. More like this.	1
6436	Alien	The one that got me into loving film. Excellent cinematography, eerie atmosphere and brilliant character interaction. Just about perfect.	2
6437	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies	One big battle scene... this movie should be retitled 1001 ways to kill an ork.  Would have greatly preferred 2 rather than 3 movies and half the battle scenes. 	0
6438	Avatar	Easily, the largest collection of WOW moments ever	2
6439	The Incredibles	it's a retro take on the Watchmen(all you pretentious people can consider objectivism and crypto-fascism while your kids enjoy the action), but with a 60's super-spy soundtrack and great day-glo colors. Completely gorgeous. Almost worth it just for the great sets and architecture.	2
6440	You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger	Lose the narrator and I'd give it 65. In Vicky Christina it was a mere annoyance, but this one was tiring. 	0
6441	Dumb and Dumber	One of the greatest comedies of all time.  Outstanding acting from Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas.  It's stupid-funny before stupid-funny existed, which means it was done well.  it's not Zoolander humor is what I mean.  This will be , and already is in my opinion, a true comedy classic.	1
6442	The Jack Bull	Intense, wonderful, deep, has action, politics, and stubborn personalities. Love.	2
6443	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	near flawless in script and execution. love the subversive tone, reflective of the subject matter itself.. super meta dark humor . 	2
6444	Annihilation	Mantık hatalarıyla dolu berbat bir film. Güzelim senaryo güzelim bütçe çöp olmuş.	1
6445	Bride Wars	ok, I laughed at International Butter Club but that's about all this movie has going for it. Every character in this is a horrible person.	2
6446	The Adventures of Tintin	Yes it's incredibly pretty and high-action, but this is not the Tintin spirit I've seen in the comics or the animated series. Why not keep what made him unique? Taken on its own, I'll have to admit it's at least a decent adventure movie.	2
6447	A Clockwork Orange	 Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is widely misunderstood us a vindication of violence as oppose to what it truly is a satire of it. One is not supposed to empathize with Alex, one is actually supposed to be revolted by his actions. If the the film seems sympathetic toward Alex it's only because it is told through his voice. Your supposed to be upset by the images on screen. It is also a commentary on the state of criminal rehabilitation and how the system consistently fails at it.	0
6448	Twin Peaks	My favorite TV series of all time.	2
6449	Evan Almighty	Pleasantly surprised.Was a litlle scared because of the plethora of bad reviews. It was fairly entertaining though without being funny through means of stupidity(ala- Will Ferrell or Jim Carey)	2
6450	Searching	Excellent storytelling. Glad it chose to forego the routes of gross voyeurism and the big bad Internet cautionary tale, ones I've come to dread when thrillers employ tech/social media as a lens.	2
6451	Good Will Hunting	God gifted boy,street fighting to show how he hate world bcoz haven't find parents love. i think about 70% lad go through it.  	0
6452	Jupiter Ascending	it was awsome i like it soo much :)	1
6453	Freddy Vs. Jason	A blah horror film, commercialized to death and played out.	0
6454	Ratatouille	it was ok	1
6455	12:01 PM	" 12:01 WAS A PIECE OF SHIT COMPARED TO GROUNDHOG DAY

IT WAS THE COLLECTIVE TISSUE BOX OF SWEATY CUM STAINS AND YOU COULD SMELL THE NECKBEARD ON THAT MOVIE FROM A MILE AWAY, THE WRITERS CAN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CRAWL BACK INTO THE BASEMENT THEY CAME FROM"	0
6456	Blade Runner	I watched this movie 20 years ago,and I was little bit confused.Last year I read the book.The book is great! I am a big SF fan,and the book is one of the best SF books that I read in my life.So,few days ago I wanted to return to the film adaptation.And I am dissapointed once again...I like only Vangelis music and that's it.The essence from the book is not in the movie,a lot of scenes and characters from the book are missing...it's like a total disaster...I hope that you will read the book...	0
6457	Goodfellas	Scorsese is in top-form,creating the best gangster film ever.Everything in this film,from the actors,to the cinematography,to the editing,to the script,to the great use of music is just perfect.	2
6458	Dirty Dancing	even if i find some parts of it funny, i enjoyed it	2
6459	Final Destination	John Denver... Died in a plane crash...	1
6460	Where the Wild Things Are	Amazing art direction!	2
6461	Die Hard	My favorite Christmas movie.	2
6462	Foreign Land	Great, overlooked Brazilian thriller taking place in both Brazil and Portugal.	2
6463	Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead	The movie is merely a recording of a play... but wow, Tom Stoppard can write and Tim Roth really delivers.	2
6464	Turkish Star Wars	A bizarre masterpiece.	2
6465	Road House	Guilty pleasure.	2
6466	Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory	Much, much better than the Tim Burton remake.  	2
6467	Alien	Almost perfect. Love the freudian influence.	1
6468	12 Angry Men	A treatment about consistent argumentation through generation of doubts in others, the interest conflicts, the racism and the hipocrisy expost. A 50-old year movie and one of the best maked. If you want let off be a blockbuster and watch a reflexive history, that is it.	2
6469	Se7en	One of the best films of all times.	2
6470	The Matrix	The best movie I saw in my entire life.	2
6471	The Mission	brillian music of Enio Morricone	1
6472	Martyrs	This was really good, but I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone.	2
6473	3 Extremes	very unusual, very weird, very interesting	2
6474	Ay Büyürken Uyuyamam	This unintentional comedy is a must-see, because it's so inexplicably bad.	0
6475	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	So much worse than the Gene Wilder version.	0
6476	Eastern Promises	Surprisingly great movie. I haven't seen any Cronenberg prior to this and I was really caught off guard by how well made it was. I always found my self deeply involved in every scene and felt really satisfied as the movie ended.	2
6477	The Big Lebowski	awesome. walters a da!!	2
6478	Twilight	The best romantic movie that includes action and horror as well.	2
6479	The Apartment	A perfect movie.  Genius.  	2
6480	The Room	Any movie this gloriously bad has to be cherished for generations. 	2
6481	May	awesome	2
6482	Harry Brown	A terrible, unpleasant mess of a film. 	0
6483	Flight of the Navigator	"LOVED it. 
Though I was 11 when I saw it, 20-odd years ago."	2
6484	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Quick humor, only scenes essential to character and plot progression, and really interesting direction. Your typical Edgar Wright movie - but when you add in humor for geeks and some real commitment to the comic-y roles, you get a really awesome movie.	2
6485	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Very well done and interesting to watch when you're a child..	2
6486	The Sound of Music	More like The Sound of Muzak if you ask me.	1
6487	The Room	Tommy Wiseau is a genius	2
6488	Bride Wars	kinda silly, but very pink, girlish and sweet.  if you're not in right mood, this can be really annoying actually.	0
6489	Brooklyn	The feels...	1
6490	Just Like Heaven	Best romantic comedy of the 00's	2
6491	Thelma	Fairy storytelling.	1
6492	The Insider	Simply of one Michael Mann's crowning achievments.  	1
6493	Pan's Labyrinth	Um dos mais belos filmes dos últimos anos. Trata com sensibilidade a beleza das histórias de fadas e a melancolia da infância.	0
6494	Wonder Woman	Great setup for her intro to the Justice League movie.	2
6495	Catwoman	would have rated it with 0, but Halle Berry is just too sexy for 0.	2
6496	Daredevil	Terrible, in a word.	0
6497	City of God	The Young and the Damned (1950)   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042804/	0
6498	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	One of the best!  The heart of what makes movies scary.	2
6499	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	The best sequel ever made. 	2
6500	Coach Carter	If you're in the mood for CITCH	1
6501	Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time	A very poorly written film, especially in terms of the character interplay which can only be described as corny. Jake Gyllenhaal will go down as one of the biggest miscasts of 2010 as his undeniably American look combined with his unnatural accent stick out like a sore thumb amidst his Persian companions.	0
6502	Guardians of the Galaxy	Funny and entertaining comic book movie, with fantastic characters like Rocket the raccoon. Light entertainment, not to take too seriously. It doesn't get you thinking, but that's definetily not something the movie is trying to achieve.	1
6503	Wanted	Great action movie and worth to see Angelina once again... Good plot.	2
6504	Bridesmaids	Some of the scenes were absolutely gut busting hilarious.  Kristen Wiig is one of my favorite comedians and she did not disappooint!	2
6505	Burlesque	There is no acting even from Cher. Cause there is no script to make a impressive acting. All is about dancing, singing and how can we show cristina's voice? worries... I gave my points to Cher song performance thats all...	2
6506	House of Wax	Paris Hilton's snatch looks like an Arby's Roast Beef Sandwich	2
6507	Paddington	Lovely. Says it all, really.	2
6508	Salt	what a waste of money, I spent most of the time worrying about how much popcorn I had left... come to think about it, I should have just bought a couple more buckets instead	0
6509	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Johnny Depp as always the best actor.. he prove it in this film.	2
6510	Candyman	He is known as şeker adam in our land xd	1
6511	The Thing	was the great one of john carpenter's Gems Creature facts Nicely done on all levels classic horror at its peak 	2
6512	The Silence of the Lambs	THTHTHTHTHTTHTH	1
6513	A Star Is Born	sucked me in. great performances and outstanding music.	2
6514	Prom Night	Damn shit movie. Worse movie I think I've ever seen, and I've seen some terrible ones. The characters were both unbelievable and unlikable. The acting was horrid. The plot was unexplainable and horribly predictable. Even the terrible original was better than this hunk of shit.	0
6515	Dances with Wolves	boring	0
6516	Midsommar	Echoes of Wickerman. In some ways better, in some ways worse. I would have preferred to come away with a clearer picture of the communities world view, and of how this extreme vision of community contrasts with the selfish individualism of the outsiders.	0
6517	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Scott Pilgram must fight through the league of evil Ex's, which consists of 8 people, to win over the girl of his dreams. Plus this movie made me feel like I was on acid.  	2
6518	Rat Race	Shitty version of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World	1
6519	Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan	KKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!	1
6520	Species II	One of the most poorly written films I have ever seen. Effects are nice though.	0
6521	The Royal Tenenbaums	pretentious and over-rated!	0
6522	Fight Club	This movie is my favorite movie of all times. It is great!	2
6523	Before We Vanish	I think this movie is the perfect match for Dark Tranquillity's song Insanity's Crescendo Amazing allegory showing how the concepts of humankind are so futile, and release from them is the 'insanity's crescendo'	2
6524	Traitor	Good movie, well made...it has the feel that it has all been done before...	2
6525	Gladiator	Legendary	2
6526	Goosebumps	I thoroughly enjoyed it. Jack Black makes this film work.	2
6527	Jason Bourne		1
6528	The Crimson Rivers	Again a Grange book but again a dissappointment	1
6529	Requiem for a Dream	Ass to ass.	1
6530	Inception	great movie!	2
6531	United 93	"Very few films these day carry a true emotional punch. Most emotions are forced onto us, some are layered with a heavy hand. Not so with united 93. Those who can vividly remember the events of 9/11, no matter where they were in the world, will know the shock and disbelief they felt. The problem with the tragic events was that it was predictable that Hollywood would get its hands on the day that changed the world. Enter Paul Greengrass.

Mr Greengrass is a blazing talent that has made his name "	2
6532	Never Let Me Go	Bleek and evocative. This movie leaves you thinking about life hard.	2
6533	Master of the Flying Guillotine	This move has had a huge influence on many modern video games and films (the Street Fighter video game, the Kill Bill films).  If you love kung-fu movies see this.	2
6534	Operation Endgame	Awful, poinless, over the top violent move, with a meaningless ending.	0
6535	Thank You for Smoking	Hilarious! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed out loud. Aaron Eckhart was superb, excellent script. I hope this movie does well at the box office.	2
6536	Hero	The Politics are a bit disturbing, but it's a top film, beautifully shot, yadda yadda. Tony Leung is astonishing.	2
6537	John Wick	It is not often you encounter a movie so pointless and idiotic and yet so well made and fun to watch. I like slayers. I like Keanu Reeves. I liked this movie.	2
6538	Lucy	Really loved this movie. It was much deeper than what I expected. It makes you think about the possibilities you posses and does it in an entertaining way. If you you are in anyway into the deeper side of Buddhist philosophy some the theories will be familiar.	2
6539	Citizen Kane	Bravely conceived and masterfully executed, the film's influence is still felt even now. A technical masterpiece, combined with a structure befitting its stature, Orson Welles crafted a film which will justifiably continue to be considered one of the best ever.	2
6540	Sahara	Good Movie	2
6541	The King of Masks	"Nearing the end of his life, Wang -- a locally renowned street performer and wizard of the venerable art of mask magic -- yearns to pass on his technique. But custom prescribes that he can only hand down his craft to a male successor. Anxious to preserve his unique art, the heirless Wang buys an impoverished 8-year-old on the black market. When the child divulges a dreaded secret, Wang faces a choice between filial love and societal tradition.

6542	Gravity	A movie that had less talking than most, but should have had much much less still. 75 for the visuals.	0
6543	The Notebook	a bit cheesy	0
6544	Taxi Driver	My God. Shatteringly great.	1
6545	Fight Club	A beautiful story!	2
6546	The Matrix	Greatest movie ever made.	2
6547	Man on Wire	I'm not sure I've ever seen a film with as inspiring lead character as Philippe and almost certainly they haven't been real. This is at times as exciting as a thriller and yet a very much like a good documentary. The combination works amazingly well and it comes together seemingly effortlessly. I think I'd like to have known more about his life both as an adult and growing up so that's why I don't give it a perfect score. But by far the best documentary I've seen, I was deeply touched & inspired	2
6548	Guardians of the Galaxy	The best aspect of Guardians is, despite all the cgi and explosions, the many quiet moments of character interaction. It also features a wonderful performance in Chris Pratt, he's perfect in the role. And I can't imagine anyone else playing the part, kind of like how Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. Other attributes include a smashing soundtrack featuring David Bowie, Jackson 5, and even Cherry Bomb by The Runaways. Guardians may not fully break the Marvel movie mold, it ranks among the best. 	1
6549	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Classic.	2
6550	The Matrix	What can I say...This is a benchmark to all action movies of all times. Great attention to details, excellent music and sound. Stylish idea. Simply the best action movie.	2
6551	The Ten Commandments	A classic telling of a timeless story, with watermark-setting performances.	2
6552	Ben	This was one of my favorites as a child.  I felt bad for the kid and his rats.  Isn't that weird..LOL.	0
6553	Dr. No	The first and one of the best.	2
6554	Breaker! Breaker!	This film is one of the movies where you just wonder who thought it was a good idea.  Also, I seriously think the inspiration for this movie was hey, this movie studio just got done filming a movie at this western set.  Let's write a movie where we can wind up destroying it.  Plus, it can't make up it's mind what it wants to be.  It's like one writer wanted a serious movie based on mysticism and martial arts, another wanted a western/pioneer movie, another wanted a trucker movie, another	0
6555	RoboCop 3	One Word: Why?	1
6556	The Matrix	there hasn't been a movie since that has really given me such a broad spectrum of intellectual, visual, emotional, and even spiritual entertainment all in one package.. honestly forever a classic. 	2
6557	Arrival	Tight, beautifully shot, and left me thinking for days afterwards.	2
6558	Close Encounters of the Third Kind	movie was garbage	0
6559	The Last Winter	Strong atmosphere and a decent musical score weren't enough to save this movie from a story so astonishingly bad that only Al Gore could appreciate it.	0
6560	Pleasures of the Flesh	Visually stunning and interesting (at least in 35MM / have heard the DVD transfers are inferior).  Complex symbolism not always easy to follow but very compelling characters and scenarios.  If you like adventurous approaches to form and style this movie and Oshimas other 1960's movies are fresher and more innovative than most anything being made today.	1
6561	Valhalla Rising	MIkkelsen is incredible. Visually the film is beautiful. The dark ambient score coupled with the occasional blood colored dream/hallucination left me anticipating that a horror film was about to break out. Actually, every scene kept me anticipating that a film was about to occur. I imagine if I put more thought into it I could parse the symbolism into something more coherent. But, I feel that may be as unrewarding as watching this film again.	0
6562	The Lion King	An overall excellent movie, and a great example of what Disney can do when they really make an effort.  A note to those complaining about the similarities to Kimba the White Lion: Do you also complain that Sergio Leone's breakout film A Fistful of Dollars is basically a carbon copy of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo?  And for that matter, Yojimbo is heavily influenced by Noir classic The Glass Key.  Cinema is adaptation, everything old is new again, so on and so forth.	2
6563	Gladiator	Amazing film and great music, no more to be said.	2
6564	Alien	What is there to say about Alien? A brilliant film that belongs in everyone's top list, at least in your sci-fi collection. There are no words I can use to properly explain how much the film revolutionized sci-fi, so I'll leave it at that!	2
6565	Snowpiercer	"The premise is laughable. It doesn't even make sense, really. There are like 200 people on this train, but somehow it's enough to maintain a full class system? After the first year the bourgeoisie would know everyone by name, even if they did hate them. 

One particular action scene in the third act is quite well made, but overall it looks cheap and is riddled with poor dialogue."	0
6566	Dazed and Confused	It'd be a lot cooler if you did	1
6567	Nukie	The most awful movie I've ever seen. The most terrible movie ever made. Painful to watch. You have to see it to see how bad a movie can be.	0
6568	Superhero Movie	I am getting tired of these spoof movies. They always cast the same people, and play off the same jokes. I am ok with satires because they are a little more subtle and require a little thinking, but these spoofs are for the dumb ass sitting there that has to have everything pointed out to them.	2
6569	Gangster Squad	A film which is not exactly blockbuster material, but does set out some amazing action scenes. An underrated performance from Penn along with a spectacular piece of script writing especially of the character portrayed by Gosling, does not do the film justice. It's the poor plot which has damaged any chance of this film gaining high ratings. However, with an all star cast and gripping action scenes, it's definitely worth a view!  	0
6570	Hero	One of the most beautiful movies you will ever put in your eyes.	2
6571	Skyfall	one of the best movies ive seen this year daniel craig is by far the best bond ever !!!!!!!	2
6572	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	For the first time Wes Anderson made a movie that I did not care for and I place the blame mostly on the lack of an Owen Wilson writing credit.  Anderson relies too much on the formula that drove Tennenbaums visual appeal but left out the all important storyline and character development.	0
6573	Donnie Darko	It's the most incredibly mind boggling I've seen in my entire life	2
6574	Home	An alien culture where citizens strive to be part of a crowd, where everyone is on their phones and running away from your problems is the admirable thing to do; the Boov are a laughable lot to us. In retrospect though, their world runs parallel to ours. It's like the #nacirema satirical case study all over again.  Watching what is essentially Rihanna and a nicer Sheldon Cooper in the same movie also blows my mind a little.	1
6575	District 9	Best Sci-fi movie since T2.	2
6576	The Da Vinci Code	It's a boring story about Gandalf playing tricks on Forrest Gump.	0
6577	Mandy	Silly in times, aesthetically not bad though.	1
6578	Gladiator	It *made* the DVD format.	1
6579	Elephant	a giant WTF	1
6580	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	Didn't get it at all	1
6581	The Martian	"Tries to be science more than entertainment. Nice to be accurate not so nice to feel like a science lecture.

Great acting from Matt Damon. Some good special effects. I Never really got the emotion."	0
6582	Coming to America	One of the best fun films Ive ever seen.	2
6583	American Flyers	While training and racing together, each fears the congenital ailment that struck down their father could suddenly strike one of them. Written by Breaking Away Oscar winner Steve Tesich and directed by John Badham(Saturday night fever), American flyers is a spirit-soaring spectacle.	2
6584	Akira	Classic anime. 	2
6585	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Outstanding movie. Great comic scenes and excellent drama. The whole package of entertainment in just one movie. Perfect acting of Jack Nicholson.	2
6586	The Sixth Sense	the plot twists of all plot twists	2
6587	Jurassic Park	What can I say? Jurassic Park was, and still is one of the best movies of all time. It has great writing, CGI, actors, you name it.	2
6588	Patch Adams	so gay!	1
6589	Poltergeist	Poltergeist is my all-time favorite movie for a lot of reasons, but the Oscar-worthy performances by Nelson and Williams is the one that stands out. It helps that Spielberg's screenwriting is every bit as excellent as the acting. Also, Poltergeist breaks the genre mold. It's thrilling, warmhearted and poignant all at once. The Freelings feel exactly like a real family, and they're likable, which makes them easy to root for. This movie has a heart, which sets it apart from other thrillers.	2
6590	Irreversible	Très cérébrale, excellent film.	2
6591	Lonesome Dove	One of the greatest Westerns made.  Being made for television doesn't diminish any of its cinematic vision or enchanting intertwined storylines. Bob Duvall at his best.	0
6592	Falling Down	Going postal.	1
6593	Remember Me	with this movie, they only want to make a political show	0
6594	The Room	The measuring stick by which all other so-bad-it's-good movies are judged.	0
6595	Moon	Great soundtrack.	2
6596	The Other Boleyn Girl	The only thing historical about this was the costumes.  Otherwise the language and sensibilities were very much modern day.  Watched about 1/2 of it and gave up.	1
6597	Cropsey	Some interesting concepts of the fictitious narratives both children and adults create to make sense of the darker elements of society and how crimes of individuals can often be traced back to the failings of governments. Ultimately, a lack of vision of what the film-makers wanted to get across and a fair heft of sensationalism made this a distinctly average documentary.	1
6598	Gangs of New York	Um dos grandes filmes de Martin Scorsese, onde junta-se suas maiores qualidades em se explorar universo e personagens a partir de analogias e simbolos.	1
6599	The Goonies	I...smell...icecream!	1
6600	Her	"Something does not feel right. 
Is this movie overrated? In my opinion, Yes! 
We all grow infatuated with our smart-gadgets this days and this is a movie that simply captures this phenomena. Maybe this is why everybody liked it.
Now excuse me while I'm on a date with my 6th Sense refrigerator. (PC operating systems are too smart for me, I prefer something more common)"	2
6601	The Cabin in the Woods	"Great beginning. Not so horrifying, occasionally scary, always quite humorous. It answers the eternal question Why are people so incredibly stupid in horror movies?. For example, why does everybody in the group suddenly agree to split up into separate rooms where they can be murdered one by one? Why? The movie finally lets us know.
The two sets or the two views of the movie complement each other very nicely.
Aaand, it has a great beginning. With nerds."	2
6602	Insidious: Chapter 2	sesle izleyici korkutmak, sinema değildir.	1

6607	Let the Right One In	Simply my favorite movie, and one of the best films ever made	2
6608	The Prestige	   abracadabra 	1
6609	Citizen Duane	This was a really good film, it didn't have a lot of boring parts in it and the humor was subtle but hilarious.  Watch it if you haven't.	2
6610	Memento	really liked this film a lot. a film you must watch more than once. great cast and direction by chris nolan. 	2
6611	Star Trek: The Motion Picture	There are parts of this film I absolutely love, but for the most part is it an extremely slow moving exposition on the exterior of space ships. If you ever need footage of the original Enterprise, this is the film to queue up.	0
6612	The Shawshank Redemption	Unoriginal and overly sentimental.	0
6613	Halloween: Resurrection	The worst one 	0
6614	Donnie Darko	A creatively cryptic fantasy drama - Donnie Darko bends the mind as much as it does space time... This is an absolutely MUST SEE movie that is like soul-food for the imagination.	2
6615	The Cowboys	Good Old Western wiht John Wayne	1
6616	Weird Science	Nostalgia glasses on: Really good movie, the boy in me liked all the computer stuff.  It was stunning witnessing what they could do at that time, connect to servers and download everything!...  It's really a non-stop nerdgasm from start to finish.  Reality glasses on:  Take it as a fairy tale set in an 80's world.  Some people wins, some peoples looses, you learn something and Robert Downey Jr is in there too.  You'll love it!	2
6617	Twilight	absolutly amazing i was waiting for this movie for so long and i loved the best movie i thinki have ever seen!!	2
6618	Street Fighter	This  movie is sooooooooo bad... it's awesomely good. It has bad acting, a bad plot, and a very bad Van Damme. How he pass as an American in any of his movies is beyond me. An excellent movie for a cheesy movie night.	0
6619	The Dark Knight	It always amazed me how overrated this movie had become. Having first saw it in the theater while on a trip to Kentucky I accepted it as a good popcorn flick, but did not think so highly of it as others have come to. There is nothing really special about this movie, the story is decent but everything else is bland and boring save for the amazing acting.	2
6620	Her	"Good movie, emotional and relationship focused.

Follows a man who falls in love with his AI OS. Eventually it cheats on him and all this other crazy shit happens.

Rather implausible universe, which affects the overall experience."	2
6621	Mulholland Drive	no other movie made me THINK so much. no other made me FEEL so much.	0
6622	Don't Be Afraid of the Dark	Lame story. Some cool atmosphere. Not worth the time to view it.	0
6623	Edison Force	seems to me that in spite of its good quality Actors (Freeman and Spacey the film is relegated to a TV teleplay styled genre 	2
6624	Rififi	Dassin's fatalistic heist thriller features one of cinema's finest moments; the breath-taking central robbery scene. It would, however, do the film a horrible injustice to solely focus on that, in the process pushing aside its most enduring quality, a deeply affecting story of inevitability, an unavoidable march towards doom.	2
6625	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Fun, and strange at times. 	2
6626	Garfield	AHHHHH WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN	0
6627	Dark Star	Strange movie. Some will hate it others really enjoy it.	0
6628	The Thing	Carpenter's best film? No doubt about it. He hasn't made a film of this caliber again, and even the Horror genre, as a whole,  hasn't seen a film of such ferocity and tension since The Thing. 	0
6629	The Swimmer	A lot of things about this are off.  The music is heavy-handed and creepy.  Lancaster is not vulnerable enough for the role.  The direction is dated.  The dialogue is writerly.  Yet, there is still something about this enigmatic journey that is worth watching --- once. 	2
6630	The Revenant	Great film but just didn't know how to finish well.	1
6631	Wanted	real action movie	2
6632	Men in Black	Witty! Will Smith is a treat and Tommy Lee Jones is always excellent. Great pairing, great writing. An action movie with heart and head. 	2
6633	The Sixth Sense	My all-time favourite movie!	0
6634	X-Men: Days of Future Past	Great movie, absolutely the best movie of x-men series	2
6635	Take Shelter	A atmosfera de mistério que vai acompanhando o desenrolar da história não funciona muito bem, e o filme vai evoluindo num ritmo entediante, situação reforçada pelos seus personagens desinteressantes. Existem algumas sequências que sobressaem, especialmente os  sonhos e a sequência final, visualmente e simbolicamente belíssima. No todo, não foi um filme que me cativou, apesar de lhe conseguir reconhecer algumas características interessantes.	1
6636	Baby Driver	While the story was almost minimal for the sake of supplying a basis for all the high paced action throughout the rest of the movie, Baby Driver is a masterclass in editing, cinematography, and really using a soundtrack to it's full potential.	0
6637	Se7en	one of the best ever	2
6638	The Cat in the Hat	Really bizarre live-action adaptation of the book, and not in a good way either.	0
6639	The Day the Earth Stood Still	Well, if you're aren't a Keanu Reeves fan, than you won't probably like it. The effects and all were good, but the were a lot of plot holes.	0
6640	Carnage	Großartiger Film, wenngleich nicht für den 0815-Kinobesucher geeignet. In einem Set so ein Dialogfeuerwerk abzubrennen ist mutig aber Polanski voll und ganz gelungen. Zu Christoph Waltz ist wohl schon alles gesagt, da reicht ein einfaches brilliant wohl mal aus.	2
6641	Unbreakable	For the fans of comics this is a must whatch	2
6642	Shaun of the Dead	dont stop me now	1
6643	The Ghost Writer	Somewhat simple in its storyline and it was easy to spot how it was going to end but not in an irritating way but in a relaxing and enjoyable fashion. The acting was ok. 	2
6644	Bad Boys II	Slightly drawn out, and at some points, delayed, but overall a good movie.  Will Smith was on cue with his usual one line quips.	1
6645	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Imaginative story and thought out plot.  Overall good entertainment for how old it is.  I also like that they don't over do the gore and effects over having a plot. 	2
6646	True Romance	A true classic.  I loved this move from start to finish.  	2
6647	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2		1
6648	You Don't Mess with the Zohan	The best advice I can give you if you're planning to see this film is You've just got to roll with it. If you do, you'll probably enjoy yourself.	2
6649	Crash	Cliched, cheesy, and predictable, this movie continually angers me everytime someone gushes about its progressiveness.  It does a disservice to minorities as well as any intelligent moviegoer by dumbing down issues which carry actual importance.	0
6650	The Game Plan	Yawn! Sitting through this made me appreciate bathroom breaks and my popcorn, which seemed much more interesting than The Rock or anything else that was on the screen. Dumb jokes, horrible acting, and an annoying young actress made time tick by quite slowly. Kids might find this entertaining, but for your sake, take them to something else.	0
6651	Serenity	THE BEST FLICK EVER MORE WATCHED BY MY WIFE & I THAN ANY OTHER	2
6652	Ted	Formulaic but fun film from Seth MacFarlane.  Features the same type of humor as his other work and features gags at a rapid pace utilizing toilet humor, sex, drugs and MacFarlane's obsessions like Star Wars.  	2
6653	Dangerous Liaisons	I thought this movie was great, I loved the cruel and unusual ways in which Meretuil and Valmont seemed to love and hate each other at the same time. Suspenseful, dangerous, brilliant, a wicked wild and daring new spin on the classic tale of love and betrayal. Close and Malkovich make a great seductive pair, and the always sexy Michelle Pfeiffer gives a tender performence in a film that soars and shocks.	2
6654	Bee Movie	Loved it!  It asks the viewer to make some strange leaps in logic (like why all of a sudden the human population accepts the fact that bees can talk), but it's very Seinfieldesque in that way.  	2
6655	Up	Great first half, extremely disappointing second half.	2
6656	Divergent	was expecting an intelligent and dark dystopian future film, instead got a teenage coming of age / romance.	1
6657	The Hunt	An intense nightmarish drama. Some people have said the plot has holes, is stupid or unrealistic. Personally i thought it all seemed plausible from start to finish.   There's been increasing discussion about sexual abuse in society and the importance of believing victims since proof of such abuse is exceedingly rare. This film paints a scenario of what could happen if we do drop due process. Many men do shy away from working with children for fear of something like this happening. 	2
6658	Moulin Rouge!	Music annoyed me. 	0
6659	Moonrise Kingdom	"Moonrise Kingdom reinvigorates its audience with the idea of love and touches the child in all of us, making us remember what it's like to have an extreme child-like devotion to something or someone.
Another incredible snapshot of a believably bizzarre world comes straight from the mind of director Wes Anderson, Moonrise Kingdom seems like it's straight out of a New England Tourism catalogue while simultaneously being devoted to nowhere in particular. It's the sweetest movie you'll see all year"	2
6660	The Kids Are All Right	story about a family consisting of two maternal figures (lesbian couple), and two teenage children, both the offspring of the same sperm donor. The movie focuses on the family's attempt to incorporate said sperm donor, played by Mark Ruffalo, into their lives, and of course this complicates the family dynamic leading to an array of consequences that range from light hearted comedy to genuine tragedy and back again. It's by no means a particularly ground breaking film but it's competent. Good.	2
6661	Twilight	ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. And Yes, I will proudly admit to being a twi-hard fan having read all 4 of the books more than once =) Can't wait for the others to be filmed 	2
6662	Fight Club	Probably Fincher's best, fantastic film. 	2
6663	Motel Hell	This movie features a chainsaw fight.  It's a movie that doesn't ever take itself seriously, and it works well because of that.  Recommended to people who like trashy horror films.	1
6664	Dark Shadows	"Really weak! I was able to predict the next scene each time. 
Probably good for kids though"	0
6665	Pulp Fiction	As films go this is sheer class and should be on everybodies must watch list, provided you enjoy a bit of violence and don't mind a bit of bad lanuage. 	2
6666	Alien: Covenant	Stupid people do stupid decisions and die stupidly. I gave it 35 score only for the following: 1. It's in my favorite franchise - I think there is no better horror idea that Alien Xenomorph by Giger. And Alien is present, even not in final form. 2. Android is great, even with all this gay shit. 3. Idea about humans&gods&robots&creators/etc. That's all folks. I hope next movie won't be such a B-movie. 	2
6667	Fight Club	this is a great movie! had to turn away alot from pain...	2
6668	Swiss Army Man	Loses its edge instantly. Feels like it was written stream-of-consciousness by an angsty teenage boy. 	0
6669	The Big Lebowski	Dude!	1
6670	The Golden Compass	bales out a bit on the complexity of the books, but the ideas in the books are legion and hard to do in film. Its beautifully visualised just similar enough and just different enough from our universe. wasted too much time in the fight sequence at Bolvanger which could have been spent building up to the daemon seperation sequence and the daemonless child scenes, both of which are agonising in the book	2
6671	The Fifth Element	I consider The Fifth Element to be my favorite film. At times you can tell Luc Besson wrote some of the screen play when he was in his early teens, but overall an excellent movie. 	2
6672	A Charlie Brown Christmas	You just can't go wrong with Charlie Brown and the Gang.	2
6673	Old Yeller	i always wanted to hit the younger brother in the film.	1
6674	Jersey Shore Shark Attack	It's the best thing Syfy film ever, but the CGI is terrible and it's still hilariously bad.	2
6675	Batman Begins	A very good movie, making Batman a darker character and a darker series than most comic book movies.  It's a great, suspenseful movie.	2
6676	D@bbe	best turkish horror ever made!	2
6677	The Matrix	Awesome action packed movie. Very futuristic and makes you think.	2
6678	Happy Feet	too much propoganda	0
6679	Le Ballon rouge	I was bored to death already after first 30 seconds and after that it just become worst.	0
6680	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	The only movie that made me cry in 2004	0
6681	Midnight in Paris	Only positive thing about this film is how nice it captures Paris. But the premise and plot are just ridiculous.	0
6682	Identity	Awesome movie. Great plot, great acting, incredible twists :) 	2
6683	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Excellent flick!  Great cast, plot, scenery, directing, etc.  I loved seeing some of the recreations from the ride.  Johnny Depp was amazing and Miss Knightley ain't hard on the eyes.	2
6684	Into the Wild	Directed by Sean Penn.  Good reviews, but  irritating true story about college boy who gives up on modern life, and goes to live on his own in the wild. Self-indulgent, should appeal to 6th formers. Also far too long.	0
6685	Europa Report	I loved it.	2
6686	Children of Paradise	shockingly, unbelievably great. beautiful images follow beautiful images. a complex story with complex characters. nothing is missing: all the constituent parts of a movie are here at a level of perfection hard to believe. beware, however: the ending does not tie up all the loose ends. that's not how european pictures were made then. further: the richest imaginable script goes by in subtitles at breakneck speed. difficult to watch: but it will change your life.	1
6687	The Twilight Saga: New Moon	my tale of this movie is about the same as others chris weitz surprised me on how well he made the movie look and feel but then settles in the annoying script there was little involvement for the vampires and werewolves main focus? Bella's annoying persona the best part is the last 30 minutes full of build up not expansion in the end myself i would like to see this series go far because i have a lot of love for vampire films but indeed this is not one and i blame it on the novels misdirection.	2
6688	Vampires Suck	I was so looking forward to a good laugh about Twilight. I was severely disappointed. This movie had maybe 2 genuinely funny moments. The rest was all sick humor meant to amuse people who are abusing drugs.	1
6689	Blood Diamond	This is my absolute favorite movie	0
6690	Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials	Maze Runner: The One Where They Run From Different Stuff. Basically Mazerunner on steroids, both in a good and bad way... If you like the fighting and action (Fighting and action = running) in Maze Runner, you should like this. If you more appreciated the quiet moments of community building, then it may not be your speed. 	0
6691	Goodfellas	Funny at times, but again, I disagree with the majority in that the movie just doesn't do it for me1	0
6692	Falling Leaves	The scene in the picture contains most of the film's interest.	0
6693	The Phantom of the Opera	I totally love the musical, but the movie... just wasn't quite up to it.	1
6694	Melancholia	"TITS
"	1
6695	Mad Max: Fury Road	Very fun movie, don't expect any type of story. 	2
6696	District 9	good	2
6697	Se7en	great!	2
6698	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom	Brilliant film! One for all the family to enjoy.	2
6699	Cocaine Cowboys	Very informative. Over all the film gives a very concise overview how the drugbarons took control over Miami and literally built the place. Then they started fighting between each other and hell broke loose. The action is hard packed. Huge editing and short clips. In the same minute you can hear several persons speaking. Often this technique bothered me - especially in the beginning - and didn't work very well but it helped keep the pace going which also suited the film very well.	2
6700	Take Shelter	Worst possible ending.	0
6701	Seven Samurai	Excellent in every degree. An engaging epic that truly lets you know the characters and feel for them. Everytime one of the seven is struck down, you feel a part of you go down with them. The final battle portion of this film is excellent and the aftermath is well directed and key to the whole film. You must see this film.	2
6702	Toy Story	An all time classic and a pioneer of the 3D animation movement. Woody and Buzz Lightyear are two of the greatest movie characters of all time, in my opinion. 	1
6703	Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story	PEOPLE COME HERE TO DANCE EROTICALLY	1
6704	Dumb and Dumber	Hilariously stupid, this movie defines many of the comedic and sarcastic sayings used still today.	0
6705	My Fair Lady	One of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady is simply exquisite. While she doesn't do her own singing, Hepburn is just fantastic, as is Harrison and the rest of the cast. While it drags at times due to its length, this film is still a must-see.	2
6706	Taxi Driver	 a Mini-Review  	1
6707	Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	Among the funniest movies in the world, but I hardly finished it :)	1
6708	The Lobster	Difficult movie to understand, but very rich in details what make it interesting. But, annoying soundtrack. Very annoying.	1
6709	American History X	for azul :))	1
6710	Jurassic Park	Masterpiece!!	2
6711	The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!	no matter where you go, there you are. i love where this movie goes from beginning to end. what's not to like about a rock and roll physicist? 	0
6712	Barbarella	For all its flaws, I rarely have a better time watching movies than when I'm watching this.  This movie does its own thing, and that particular thing is pretty damn fun.	2
6713	Series 7: The Contenders	First off it's not a movie criticizing reality TV, it's a dark humour movie. The execution is spot on (with ad breaks and all!) but the characters lack personality, even if the acting is pretty good.	0
6714	Hidden Figures	I really enjoyed the movie. I did find the drama side a bit boring and took me out of the immersion, but I understand why it was there. The only reason I have marked it down was I found it a bit preachy and it made out that the black women did every single little thing. Good nonetheless, and the women are finally getting recognition they deserve. 	0
6715	Monsters, Inc.	great movie.  animation is awesome and it is funny enough for adults and kids to love it.	2
6716	Serenity	Superb. I'm a Whedon fan and it gave me everything I wanted. Man's a genius.	2
6717	Day of the Dead	Brains!!!! Zombies brought me and my husband together, so I give them nothing but love.	1
6718	Home Alone	Gets funnier everytime I watch it	2
6719	Commando	This thing is so mindless and rote that it's actually very entertaining. I find myself watching just for a goof whenever it's on broadcast tv.	0
6720	Limelight	The simplicity in this movie is amazing! Felt in love with every single scene!	2
6721	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Class movie.	2
6722	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	the best!	2
6723	Scarface	Ne çektin be Tony..	1
6724	The Stepford Wives	The original film is a classic of horror and to be honest, it totally creeped me out.  So, with a cast like Kidman, Walken, Broderick and Close, I was expecting something decent.  This remake is literally a joke and more of a parody of the original than anything else.  There is nothing particularly subtle about the humor and the horror is all but gone.  Not worth anyone's time, not even for a laugh.  	0
6725	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2	i liked it a lot and the best harry potter movie.	1
6726	The Man from Earth	As evilchaser says, if it was made in the '60, it would would have been a classic. Although it made me think about lots of things, I don't think I'll bear this movie in mind for long.	0
6727	The Room	An amazing movie to see at a theatre with an audience; the film is so terrible that it's good. Really fun if you interact with the film. SPOONS!	2
6728	Whiplash	"Gaza getir eğitimi. Aklımda kalan cümlesi. Birisine fena değildi demek büyük sorumluluktur bu yüzden bu yüzyılda deha müzisyenler çıkmıyor.
"	1
6729	Bubba Ho-Tep	"bruce campbell in his prime sorta fun origanal story must see
 "	2
6730	Hell	Very, very lame.	0
6731	The Invitation	Although it's slow paced, the first and second arcs of the Invitation are building up the tension phenomenally, while creating believable characters and relationships. However, the reveal is disappointingly obvious and the finale falls short with no real payoff at the end.	0
6732	Boyhood	This movie is a hauntingly accurate portrayal of many aspects of growing up. It is an emotionally exhausting film that depicts extraordinarily realistic and multi-layered character development across the cast. In a way, I almost regret watching it because it is a painful reminder of how life can often be unpredictable yet thoroughly uneventful.  	2
6733	Gentleman's Agreement	High points for Celeste Holm's character Anne Dettrey; sadly, many more negative points for the heavy-handed magic wand that ends Kathy's hypocrisy, and the character of Kathy herself. 	0
6734	Split	Twisted! 	0
6735	Twilight	I give this movie a high score for the romance and darkness of the vampire characters.	2
6736	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	The only movie that made me cry in 2004	0
6737	Midnight in Paris	Only positive thing about this film is how nice it captures Paris. But the premise and plot are just ridiculous.	0
6738	Identity	Awesome movie. Great plot, great acting, incredible twists :) 	2
6739	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Excellent flick!  Great cast, plot, scenery, directing, etc.  I loved seeing some of the recreations from the ride.  Johnny Depp was amazing and Miss Knightley ain't hard on the eyes.	2
6740	The Shining	This film would have been very good, had I not read the book beforehand. The book was so brilliant that this adaptation paled in comparison, and the changes made to the plot seemed unnecessary.	0
6741	Fireflies in the Garden	It was one of the most emotional movie i've seen . I love movies about family dramas and it was a wonderful example of that type of movies. The acting was very successful. Especially Julia Roberts was great an Oscar nomination is very possible for her .. And I loved pregnant Roberts she looks gorgeous. The cast deserves a SAG nomination. There're a lot of things I really loved about this movie ! 	2
6742	Inception	I truly can't think of a bad thing to say about this film, so totally awesome	2
6743	The Fifth Element	Great actors, great effects, a futuriste time, some great weapons, wonderfull vehicles and a great direction i don't need more to say.	2
6744	The Raid: Redemption	While video games like 'Heavy Rain' attempt to create the experience of an interactive movie, this movie seems to be the first-ever attempt at a non-interactive video game. A very bad video game! The only hint of story is the opening sequence, after that it is essentially one long, long fighting scene. The choreography is fine and the only reason why I don't give this movie a score of zero. But even that gets boring after the first 20 minutes. Frustrating and pointless!	0
6745	Tora! Tora! Tora!	Better than Pearl Harbor	0
6746	Suspiria	A masterfully filmed, haunting, at times cheesy but most of the time intense, operatic film with amazing psychedelic cinematography. Has nightmare-like qualities. Though the actual gore may seem dated and unrealistic, the murder scenes stay striking and powerful in their creative executions, the first one probably being one of the most intense ever filmed. One of the film's major highpoints is also the wonderful score by Italian prog rock band Goblin. Definetly worth a watch for horror fans.	2
6747	The Beat That My Heart Skipped	A fairly good film. Duris' character is nervous, intense, and hard to sympathize with - but played brilliantly nevertheless.	2
6748	Glengarry Glen Ross	Mostly boring and without any particularly likable characters.	0
6749	Her	"Good movie, emotional and relationship focused.

Follows a man who falls in love with his AI OS. Eventually it cheats on him and all this other crazy shit happens.

Rather implausible universe, which affects the overall experience."	2
6750	Hitch	It's about time the multiplex features a romantic comedy with a multi-cultural cast. As a New Jersean, I can honestly say Hitch did for New York what Pretty Woman did for Rodeo Drive. The city is appealing, the premise is intriguing and the acting quite wonderful. Only lovelorn prudes that have no hope of a great sex life could hate this movie.	2
6751	X-Men: Days of Future Past	really entertaining, maybe the best x-men film? that the film basically throws x-men 3 in the bin is fantastic	2
6752	Dogtooth	A *cunt* is a large lamp. The *cunt* switched off and the room got all dark.	1
6753	3 Ninjas	Tum Tum could have carried this on his own, the other two ninjas were holding him back.	0
6754	Se7en	Turn it around, baby	1
6755	Love Actually	I fucking hated this movie. I'm told this makes me broken, and I don't care.	0
6756	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	How can a man attain godliness? He searches to create the scent of heaven... Beautifully written and acted. 	2
6757	Where the Wild Things Are	Kid was too much of a brat for me to enjoy this flick. I understand his life is tough and all, but come on!	2
6758	The 5 Deadly Venoms	In my opinion, this is the greatest kung fu film of all time. Wild styles, expert choreography, and real talent on the part of the actors meet one of the genre's most intriguing stories. As in any martial arts film, the fights are the most important thing, and the battles featured here are lengthy, meaty, and a complete joy to watch. If you are looking for an introduction to the martial arts genre, there is no better movie than this one.	1
6759	Gladiator	Its a great movie, i would watch it again	2
6760	The Incredibles	As of 2017, I still consider this the best Pixar movie ever made. Memorable characters, great pacing, interesting premise. If any movie deserves a sequel, it's this one.	2
6761	The Sentinel	Take some guys with wishes to win easy money copyng the formula of the serie 24, a cast who think their`re good (specially Michael Douglas...boy, time to retire now!) and you'll have this. The note? Not a coincidence...at all! 	0
6762	Get Out	I felt really disturb and anguish during this film by the characters and the atmosphere. The music also participate in that feelings. I think it is a good point to say that the film is well done. You wonder a lots of things.  The scenario seems real but it is not really.  	0
6763	His Name Was Jason: 30 Years of Friday the 13th	A fun, if somewhat lighthearted, look at how the Friday the 13th franchise continues to endure even after three decades of slaughter. 	2
6764	Freddy Got Fingered	Freddy Got Fingered is pure fuck you art. 	1
6765	Hababam Sınıfı Yeniden	Şu hababam sınıfı devam filmlerini çekmekten ne zaman vazgeçecekler acaba? Hababam sınıfı serisine saygı duyun ve bırakın bunu yapmayı çünkü kötü olarak bile nitelendirilemeyecek seviyede.	0
6766	Halloween	By which all others are compared	1
6767	Let the Right One In	Fantastic!	2
6768	Toy Story	A pioneer of animated movies and brings the joys of nostalgic childhood imagination back to those who watch.	2
6769	Breach	great movie, suspenseful, even though you know the outcome, you are kept on the edge of your seat in many scenes 	2
6770	The Evil Dead	an excellent low-budget horror movie	2
6771	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	Amazing from start to finish. One of the best movies of all time.	2
6772	Shaun of the Dead	Funny! Smart too. Worth a watch. you might even show it to a friend afterwards.	2
6773	The Prestige	Christopher Nolan's adaptation is true thriller that is beautifully cast and executed. Full of twists and tons of suspense, Nolan and crew were able to craft a film carefully hides the truth right before you eyes. Bale and Jackman give wonderful performances as rivals and competitors who are always trying to one up each other. One of my all-time favorites.	2
6774	Fast & Furious 6	Nice movie but the action is extremely exaggerated.  	1
6775	Alphaville	'The comic strip side of Alphaville could be taken for a Brechtian form of distanciation, for it is evident from the film's beginning that ironic distance must be maintained throughout the film. Otherwise, what is one to make of a film in which Lemmy Caution, the French Mickey Spilane, drives into Alphaville in a Ford Galaxy that has just traversed intergalactic space?' -Allen Thiher  This quote reminded me of how much I love this movie.	2
6776	That's My Boy	Probably the worst film I saw all year, including whatever Twilight junk was released in 2012.	0
6777	Stand by Me	Great coming of age film!	2
6778	Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party	The worst piece of propaganda I have ever seen. Apparently Dinesh is incapable of understanding that there was a paradigm shift in the parties right around the civil rights movement. This is as misleading, if not more so, than the propaganda Joseph Goebbels was spewing nearly a century ago. I'm guessing anyone with half a brain has come to this conclusion already. The rest of you should be lobotomized.	0
6779	Journey to the Center of the Earth	Really good family film. I couldn't find better film to sit down with my family and just chill and have fun. Only thing that pointed out too offen was that 3D shit. I really hate 3D for lots of reasons. But I liked, my family liked and couldn't ask anything else from family adventure film.	2
6780	Bronson	Powerful performance by Tom Hardy; physically intimidating and mentally insane without being overly ridiculous. The movie itself is abstract, yet weirdly compelling. 	2
6781	Midsommar	The craziest film I have seen in a cinema. A profound piece that simultaneously manages to create the most surreal and horrific, yet beautiful scenes. Visually stunning throughout and some of the opening scenes feel disturbingly real and thus drag you in from the off. Highly recommend.	2
6782	AVP: Alien vs. Predator	boring	0
6783	Big	Classic Tom Hanks, probably not a movie that would hold up well today but still a great 80s movie	2
6784	Super deluxe	One of the most underrated film of the last decade. It is funny,emotional and at the same time makes us question our existence and ponder on the deeper meaning of life. Definitely an eye opener and rarely does a film affect us to this extent and linger on in our minds for months after watching.	2
6785	The Birds	Grows more fascinating with each viewing - the second half remains suspenseful and terrifying, but the first half, which explores the film's human relationships, really gels with repeat viewings.  I was dismissive of the idea that Melanie's growing attraction to Mitch and involvement in his life was the main cause of the birds' attack, but the notion grows more and more plausible with each viewing.	0
6786	The Irishman	Scorsese tells this story in a very realistic way. Actors are perfect. It didn't bore me at any moment in 3.30 hours. Movie is incredibly well-edited the way Scorsese showing the tree periods of their life at the same time is flawless. Music choises are so good. I think everyone should watch this movie.  	2
6787	Videodrome	Ahead of its time and disturbingly prophetic, Videodrome represents a needed stepping stone as Cronenberg evolved from body-horror.  	0
6788	Peppermint Candy	An unforgettable masterpiece by one of Korea's greatest directors.	2
6789	Hedwig and the Angry Inch	Best music ever - one of my favorite soundtracks - but the flow of the movie is lacking.	1
6790	Flushed Away	Extemely funny and witty. loved every minute, especially the singing slugs. (you'll see.) some really gross humor if you pay clooooose attention. DVD has a GREAT commentary.	2
6791	Blade Runner 2049	Ambiance is excellent, the dialogue is conveyed to explicitly state what is currently happening and what the audience should be thinking. Probably to avoid the esotericism of the original where the director felt he had to make a narrated version: . . . audience members indicated difficulty understanding the [original] film	2
6792	American Gangster	Well acted -- especially by Crowe -- but with excrutiating pacing while, at the same time, too little time spent on certain crucial elements.  A missed opportunity, in my mind.	0
6793	Jersey Girl	awful	0
6794	Lost in Translation	White Whine: The Movie.	1
6795	Cloud Atlas	So bad	0
6796	Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol	Tom Cruise gets smashed a lot.	1
6797	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	this is a great series with wonderful cast and great special effects.	2
6798	Hostel	utter crap- why is Tarantino considered a genius?	0
6799	Buffalo Soldiers	Funny and dark.	2
6800	Akira	Masterpiece of animation.	2
6801	Lake Placid	This movie isn't what you'd expect from this genre.  Loaded with comedy to go along with the fright and gore, you'll sometimes finding yourself laughing at the reactions of the people who are experiencing the terror of dealing with a 30 foot croc.  Much better than anticipated.	0
6802	Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me	Absolutely astounding; Lynch's greatest film, and one of the most purely, viscerally emotional films ever made.	2
6803	Grave of the Fireflies	This is quite possibly the saddest film i've ever seen. Its the kind of movie you struggle to watch again once you've seen it, despite how powerful and well done it is.	1
6804	Finding Nemo	Ellen Degeneres, believe it or not, absolutely makes this film. Great animation to boot.	0
6805	Grandma's Boy	it has some laughs.  Not bad	2
6806	Trainspotting	simplemente perfecta.	1
6807	The Martian	so light on charater development, plot and general grown-upiness it was enjoyable but a dissapointment	2
6808	Donnie Darko	This movie doesn't give you all the answers you would hope for. It doesn't change the world, or at least the real world. I find it to be simply an interesting trip. For those who need a straight line of thought, please everyone movie, well this is not for you. The director's cut has nice improvements.	2
6809	Pulp Fiction	Den var altfor lang og kjedelig. mikset med tidslinjen	1
6810	Insidious: Chapter 2	sesle izleyici korkutmak, sinema değildir.	1
6811	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Love, Love, Love it. My kind of movie.	2
6812	Shaun of the Dead	94	1
6813	No Country for Old Men	http://kimisfansfilmtavsiyeleri.blogspot.com/2013/05/no-country-for-old-men-2007.html	1
6814	Guardians of the Galaxy	Fena değil, komik, yan karakterler başarılı. Klasik amerikan filmi geyiklerinden nasibini almış.	1
6815	Let the Right One In	Simply my favorite movie, and one of the best films ever made	2
6816	The Prestige	   abracadabra 	1
6817	Citizen Duane	This was a really good film, it didn't have a lot of boring parts in it and the humor was subtle but hilarious.  Watch it if you haven't.	2
6818	The Passion of Anna	A masterpiece of Cinema.	2
6819	The Iron Lady	disgusting	0
6820	xXx	Why does this movie, which is marketed as XTREEEEEME BOND have XXX not killing anyone whereas Bond kills everyone?	2
6821	Female Trouble	the firstJohn Waters film I saw. Have been a fan os his warped and depraved mind ever since.	0
6822	Donnie Darko	If I could rank a movie -1000 I would.  Most despised movie of all time.  More irritating are the people who insist I just don't get this pos.  I get it, I just thought it the most boring flick of all time. 	0
6823	Birdman	Iñárritu got the Oscar.	2
6824	Elite Squad: The Enemy Within	add some political and action elements to cidade de deus and there you go!	2
6825	Corridor	Best thriller I've seen in a long time. 	2
6826	Bewitched	Next time write a script BEFORE you start shooting.  And if you HAVE to make features from old TV shows, try to make them better than the original material.	0
6827	Dog Day Afternoon	A nervous thriller staring Pacino and Cazale, former Corleone brothers, as inexperienced bank-robbers on a hot Brooklyn day. Released in 1975, this movie resonates an uneasy turbulence about the precarious nature of the United States, perhaps seen in Pacino's character of Sonny, a decent man who finds himself in an indecent society. Police brutality, Vietnam, and qualms about homosexual identity violently corrode what was intended to be a simple bank heist...	2
6828	My Name Is Bruce	Everyone liked Bubba Ho-Tep. I really have no idea what I'd make of this film if I wasn't already a Bruce Campbell fan. Thankfully, I won't have this problem, and can really enjoy even more Bruce Campbell.	2
6829	The Magnificent Seven	Too much gratuitous killing	0
6830	The Wizard of Oz	love the technicolor!	2
6831	Mysterious Skin	Lovely movie	2
6832	Sin City	nice translation from comic to screen. great job. 	2
6833	Dirty Harry	I love this movie. So many classic lines.	2
6834	True Romance	lalala	1
6835	Gladiator	Very powerful an entertaining.   Good political study.	2
6836	The Revenant	Masterful cinematography, artful directing and magical soundtrack.	2
6837	Anger Management	awesome movie!!! so funny!	2
6838	The Notebook	A story about True love. This movie will surely  make you smile, cry and fall inlove at the same time.  	2
6839	I Heart Huckabees	Pitch perfect satirical look at the questions that plague us all.	2
6840	Dark City	You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human. Well, you're not going to find it.. in here. You went looking in the wrong place.	2
6841	Se7en	Beautiful :) But i don't like end of the film.	1
6842	Coherence	I really loved this movie. It needs a PTPM counter (plot twist per minute), if you are up for not eating popcorn, but your fingernails instead (ok don'really do that) then watch this movie.	2
6843	The Shawshank Redemption	One of the most complete and satisfying films ever made.	2
6844	Dead Man Walking	I saw it many year ago. I don't remember any details. i just remember that the whole idea was great and caught me and made me thinking. 	2
6845	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	There should be a disclaimer when you buy your tickets that says: Batman and Superman fight for only like 5 minutes. That's it. The promise of the premise is 5 minutes long. And the entire thing is 3 hours long. Talk about a scam.	0
6846	Touch of Evil	Just watch any scene to be aware of how it came close to perfection.	2
6847	Made In France	Frappant, mais peu réaliste.	1
6848	Taxi Driver	Great movie. A man that can't stand any more. 	2
6849	American History X	Edward Norton is quite possibly the best actor of his era. He proves that once again in this very, verrry good movie. Very few movies and acting performances make you think about the morals in the movie as much as this one. There are really too many good things to say about this movie. A movie that matters and is oddly enough also kind of cool to watch because of all the toughness in it. Life is too short to hate but it's also too short to not have seen this movie. So watch it... now!	0
6850	The Artist	Charming.  	2
6851	Surf Nazis Must Die	THIS... MOVIE... IS... BORING!	0
6852	Lost in Translation	The most boring film ever.	0
6853	Dune	Sort of a guilty pleasure I guess.	0
6854	The Sixth Sense	you would never guess	1
6855	Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus	That shark jumping was the only scene worth watching.	0
6856	Jurassic Park	I watch it every year, over and over again. It remainds me of the times, when dinosaures were important part of my life (my childhood) and they were just AWESOME. Great flick.	2
6857	Leaving Las Vegas	I had to search on the internet if alcoholism can really become this terrible. The most depressing part of the movie is that the answer is yes.	0
6858	Kanal-i-zasyon	Turk televizyolarina yapıilmis eglenceli bir elestiri.	1
6859	Midsommar	I would consider this movie not to be a horror film, but a guide to superior living conditions.  The murder rate of this town is FAR lower than the murder rate of christians as a whole (i.e. which hunts, sexual persecution, disabled/retard persecution(nazis,which hunts, etc., etc...), racism, general discrimination, holocausts, crusades, etc... etc... etc... a never ending unbroken chain of hate, intolerance, and murder).	0
6860	The Machine	Wow! That hit the spot.	2
6861	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Such a wasted potential...	0
6862	Malibu's Most Wanted	Wonderbread dumpster = beautiful	2
6863	Cars	Very good	2
6864	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Love it!	2
6865	Easy A	Stanley Tucci is the MAN!!	1
6866	Great Balls of Fire!	I dislike Dennis Quaid, but I enjoyed him as a pedophile. 	2
6867	Batman Begins	Christian Bale as batman alone is enough reason to see this movie. Best Batman ever !	1
6868	Toy Story	one of my chilldhood favs this movie is really really funny i really like that part is where buzz says u are a strange little man 	2
6869	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Well, what can I say? Tolkien was the grandfather of modern fantasy, and Peter Jackson made an excellent film that lived up to the franchise name. 	2
6870	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom	Brilliant film! One for all the family to enjoy.	2
6871	Cocaine Cowboys	Very informative. Over all the film gives a very concise overview how the drugbarons took control over Miami and literally built the place. Then they started fighting between each other and hell broke loose. The action is hard packed. Huge editing and short clips. In the same minute you can hear several persons speaking. Often this technique bothered me - especially in the beginning - and didn't work very well but it helped keep the pace going which also suited the film very well.	2
6872	The House of the Devil	More style than substance, Ti West crafts an effective thriller in the vein of Dario Argento and his giallo horror contemporaries. Well acted, well shot, and, interestingly enough, very much a 1980s period piece. Worth seeing in the theater or via Amazon.com's rental service.	2
6873	The War of the Worlds	ridiculous and poor acting	0
6874	Heat	Nothing short of GENIUS!!	1
6875	Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom	the best one from the trilogy. ( not including the latest one)	2
6876	The Fifth Element	One of my all-time favorites. Bruce Willis really shines.	2
6877	Perfect Blue	Psychosis, madness, paranoia, lost of identity...Pure genius.	1
6878	13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi	"Full of unnecessary sound special effects. The jokes in this movie sound really retarded, the characters exhibit unrealistic behavior. I don't really know how to survive through the hole movie with such numb dialogs.
"	0
6879	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	This movie is AMAZING!Johnny Depp is one hot pirate and Orlando Blloom is a hot blachsmith becoming a pirate just to save the girl he loves life! This move is very adventurous and funny! After I saw this I couldn't wait till the second one comes out! This is a must have movie at home!	1
6880	Alfie	Absolutely brilliant. Caine was made for this role. Hilarious and charming, great interaction between characters and beatifully filmed in 60's London. Caine aptly fluctuates between barefaced cheek and flirt to loneliness and despair effortlessly. Much better than i thought it would be	2
6881	Xanadu	A blast from the past - Grease meets Singing in the Rain (on roller skates no less!)  yep they had some good drugs in 1980	2
6882	Zelig	I have to admit. I only saw 30 minutes of the film and got bored. I thought it a great idea, but the jokes are not funny in my opinion (at least in these 30 minutes). I will probably try another day.	0
6883	Juno	Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. If you like that song you also like this lovely movie.	2
6884	Pride & Prejudice	Not normally the kind of movie I'd see, but I really liked it.	2
6885	The Truman Show	This is one of the most MOVING and symbolic movies I've ever seen.  Jim Carrey's vulnerability and determination as the truth unfolds is at once heart-breaking and inspiring.  This movie truly touched me.  	2
6886	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom	Not much new. Great action near the end, but don't expect to be thrilled by the story, just the special effects and the scares in the last 30 minutes. There is also some well placed humor	2
6887	Aliens	brilliant!!!!	2
6888	Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!	One of the worst movies I've ever seen! Pure garbage!	0
6889	And Now for Something Completely Different	Worthless if you've seen Flying Circus, as the execution and delivery in this film is considerably worse than it is in the series. Only for obsessives, or people who have never seen Flying Circus.	0
6890	The Lion King	ITS THE LION KING IT ROCKS	1
6891	Forrest Gump	"one of the most unsettling and dangerous films ever made. 
its idolization of ignorance is a triumph for the dull, the stupid
and the ignorant. movies like this ruin america
"	0
6892	Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne	Ladies of the Park!?!?? Please can we not have the original title listed; that's just awful.  A great film, by the way, some 30 years ahead of its time.	2
6893	The Silent Partner	Canadian cinema at its best. Does not pull any punches or pretend to be anything other than it is. Convincing performances all around.	0
6894	The Notebook	it really makes me cry sad but realictic story	1
6895	Back to the Future	The BEST film EVER!	2
6896	Inception	"I think the matrix has stronger story than the Inception.
But notice the last sence,"	1
6897	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	n/a. 100. seriously.	1
6898	Total Recall	Couldn't even finish this atrocity. TERRIBLE GARBAGE. It was a celluloid bimbo. Really pretty, but dumb as hell. 	0
6899	Die Hard	Boring. Too much suspense leads to boredom.	0
6900	Casino Royale	Bond film without any of the elements that make up a bond file. Ok action movie, I guesss...	0
6901	The Man from Earth	As evilchaser says, if it was made in the '60, it would would have been a classic. Although it made me think about lots of things, I don't think I'll bear this movie in mind for long.	0
6902	The Room	An amazing movie to see at a theatre with an audience; the film is so terrible that it's good. Really fun if you interact with the film. SPOONS!	2
6903	Whiplash	"Gaza getir eğitimi. Aklımda kalan cümlesi. Birisine fena değildi demek büyük sorumluluktur bu yüzden bu yüzyılda deha müzisyenler çıkmıyor.
"	1
6904	Bubba Ho-Tep	"bruce campbell in his prime sorta fun origanal story must see
 "	2
6905	The Fog of War	A must if you have got glimpse of responsibility and empathy in you.	2
6906	Fruitvale Station	One of the best movies of the year for sure. Incredibly moving, obviously, if you know the back story. The acting is incredible, its message is especially gut-wrenching right now and the story unfolds without resorting to cheese or cliches. Its an essential movie in my opinion. 	2
6907	The Big Lebowski	8.7/10 Another classic movie I could watch over and over again, the kind of movie that really brings the room together.	2
6908	Trainspotting	it was awesome but had some disguting parts...which made it even better	2
6909	The Cabin in the Woods	Easily one of my favorite films of 2012, and my pick of best horror film of this decade.	2
6910	The Rules of Attraction	Has been my favorite movie for a long time. I knew James van der beek only from dawson's creek and he blew my mind in this movie. It's a shame he never did anything as good or memmorable after this one. I still hope he will.  Beautifully shot, great acting, amazing soundtrack!	2
6911	Gladiator	Awesome but I'm not too sure I can watch it repeatedly 	0
6912	Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie	Great Job!	2
6913	Lucy	one of the worst movies, but sort of badgood	0
6914	The Artist	Beautifully shot, beautifully told. Jean Dujardin comes across as the epitome of the early Hollywood male starts. He charms, he acts, he dances. To me, he resembles Clark Gable or a young Kevin Kline--he's a charmer. Bérénice Bejo and he have great chemistry on the screen. (and Uggie will remind fans of Asta from The Thin Man!)	2
6915	Blade Runner 2049	For me this is the film that comes closest to being the perfect masterpiece. Phenomenal directing by one of the most talented filmmakers today, jaw-dropping cinematography by arguably one of the greatest masters of cinematography, the score is in my opinion much deeper and richer than the original's and lastly the acting is also almost nearly flawless. This is the film I'll re-watch if I'm ever unsatisfied with present cinema.	2
6916	Inception	amazing plot, amazing vfx, amazing movie	2
6917	Flight	The lawyer called someone to administer cocaine to his client, wtf is up with this movie.	0
6918	Blade Runner 2049	Story: 9.5 Atmosphere: 10 Amazing movie demonstrating possible future dystopia. Story is well written but unsatisfactory (Wallace arc). Otherwise, the plot alludes to a future sequel (hopefully)	2
6919	Mulholland Drive	Well,it's a very difficult movie but I think the meaning is very deep.	2
6920	Pee-wee's Big Adventure	Tim Burton's only legitimately great movie. Timeless, classic.	2
6921	The Goonies	classic	2
6922	Smokin' Aces	A little too over-the-top for its own good.  Another film trying too hard to be Lock Stock.  Stupid ending. 	0
6923	Gamer	this movie was just so increibly bad and sterotypical, its like a 13 year old couterstriker fan made it And my eyes still hurt, there was nearly never one second without 3 cut scenes, strobes or flickering	0
6924	The Raid: Redemption	I actually don't like action movies that much and I thought I would have been bored to death during the film, but it's proven all wrong. Even though there is a miniscule story-plot, I've enjoyed The Raid so much. The fighting scenes are very impressing and ballet-like and I actually don't think it 's more violent than a Hollywood action movie. (Soundtrack is also a bonus)	2
6925	The Man Who Would Be King	Two men reach for a chance to play at being gods and pay the price for being human.	1
6926	Zero Dark Thirty	Exceptionally overrated.  Not a terrible movie, but it missing any sort of character development that would cause the audience to become emotionally invested in the movie.  Overall it was only mildly interesting.	0
6927	Se7en	Top-notch psycho thriller. One of the top ten ever made. 	1
6928	The Twilight Saga: New Moon	so boring and losers were crying in the cinema over it ahhhhh	0
6929	Kung Fu Hustle	Just plain dumb.	0
6930	The Swimmer	A lot of things about this are off.  The music is heavy-handed and creepy.  Lancaster is not vulnerable enough for the role.  The direction is dated.  The dialogue is writerly.  Yet, there is still something about this enigmatic journey that is worth watching --- once. 	2
6931	Requiem for a Dream	Overrated	1
6932	Shotgun Stories	A little slow at the beginning but builds the suspense nicely and I appreciated the realism. Well worth a look.	2
6933	X-Men: Days of Future Past	I loved the use of time travel in this narrative - first time I saw it used in this way. Movie was a fun ride. 	2
6934	12:01 PM	" 12:01 WAS A PIECE OF SHIT COMPARED TO GROUNDHOG DAY

IT WAS THE COLLECTIVE TISSUE BOX OF SWEATY CUM STAINS AND YOU COULD SMELL THE NECKBEARD ON THAT MOVIE FROM A MILE AWAY, THE WRITERS CAN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CRAWL BACK INTO THE BASEMENT THEY CAME FROM"	0
6935	Blade Runner	I watched this movie 20 years ago,and I was little bit confused.Last year I read the book.The book is great! I am a big SF fan,and the book is one of the best SF books that I read in my life.So,few days ago I wanted to return to the film adaptation.And I am dissapointed once again...I like only Vangelis music and that's it.The essence from the book is not in the movie,a lot of scenes and characters from the book are missing...it's like a total disaster...I hope that you will read the book...	0
6936	Goodfellas	Scorsese is in top-form,creating the best gangster film ever.Everything in this film,from the actors,to the cinematography,to the editing,to the script,to the great use of music is just perfect.	2
6937	Dirty Dancing	even if i find some parts of it funny, i enjoyed it	2
6938	Final Destination	John Denver... Died in a plane crash...	1
6939	Dunkirk	Not Good for Nolan, Just a story with things happening. Plot is not interesting	0
6940	Mad Max: Fury Road	I really don't see what's good in this movie, besides the fact that it actually makes fun of serious action movies with its '80s tone and ridiculous characters. The figure of Max is rendered completely useless, while the whole story is just lame. The best thing are the thugs, lots of fun	1
6941	He Was a Quiet Man	Despite it's multiple flaws, He Was a Quiet Man is a great flick. The plot twist was completely unexpected.	2
6942	The Prestige	Best movie ever	2
6943	We Are the Best!	a little sheltered for punks, eh?	0
6944	The Matrix	i love films like this	2
6945	Whiplash	Good film. A simple story of commitment added some (over the top) drama. 	2
6946	Permanent Vacation	"not my type of movie,but had a lot to say!
"	1
6947	Road House	I rated this as a drama, but as a comedy it's surely a 70.	1
6948	Trainspotting	One film that I can watch over and over and not tire of. The first time I realized what an unappreciated gem of an actor Ewan MacGregor is. 	1
6949	Inception	"awesome movie 
  i say you it really happens in your real life"	2
6950	Man on Fire	Denzel is the man! This was one of the best movie I have ever seen and  one of my favorites. Man On Fire has a beautiful story line of Redemption entwined with all the ass kick-in  action you could want. Denzel has a confidence in himself that comes alive on the screen, making his characters larger than life, even when he is playing a character that is broken like Creasy. In fact, Denzel has that common thread in the way he plays all his characters confidence in their ability.	0
6951	Flushed Away	Extemely funny and witty. loved every minute, especially the singing slugs. (you'll see.) some really gross humor if you pay clooooose attention. DVD has a GREAT commentary.	2
6952	Blade Runner 2049	Ambiance is excellent, the dialogue is conveyed to explicitly state what is currently happening and what the audience should be thinking. Probably to avoid the esotericism of the original where the director felt he had to make a narrated version: . . . audience members indicated difficulty understanding the [original] film	2
6953	American Gangster	Well acted -- especially by Crowe -- but with excrutiating pacing while, at the same time, too little time spent on certain crucial elements.  A missed opportunity, in my mind.	0
6954	Jersey Girl	awful	0
6955	Lost in Translation	White Whine: The Movie.	1
6956	Cloud Atlas	So bad	0
6957	Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol	Tom Cruise gets smashed a lot.	1
6958	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	this is a great series with wonderful cast and great special effects.	2
6959	Hostel	utter crap- why is Tarantino considered a genius?	0
6960	The Fog of War	A must if you have got glimpse of responsibility and empathy in you.	2
6961	Fruitvale Station	One of the best movies of the year for sure. Incredibly moving, obviously, if you know the back story. The acting is incredible, its message is especially gut-wrenching right now and the story unfolds without resorting to cheese or cliches. Its an essential movie in my opinion. 	2
6962	The Big Lebowski	8.7/10 Another classic movie I could watch over and over again, the kind of movie that really brings the room together.	2
6963	Trainspotting	it was awesome but had some disguting parts...which made it even better	2
6964	The Cabin in the Woods	Easily one of my favorite films of 2012, and my pick of best horror film of this decade.	2
6965	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	Not as good as the original	0
6966	Jennifer's Body	I hope Ms. Fox never acts again	0
6967	13 Sins	it was good	2
6968	Hero	This movie combines art and adventure. Its just worth to see the movie because of the colors and settings. A true epic movie!	2
6969	Van Helsing	dull as dishwater and twice as flimsy	0
6970	Holy Motors	I tried to like it, but it is too abstract, slow-paced and boring for me. It felt to me like the stretching of a concept to torturous levels. Is it about identity? I thought so, but still didn't enjoy it, overall.	0
6971	The Art of Getting By	Wannabe Holden Caufield except more artsy broodiness but still as annoying.	0
6972	The Incredibles	best animated movie ever.......	2
6973	The Hudsucker Proxy	The first half is brilliant, but then it seems to spiral out of control.	2
6974	Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs	Its a classic!	2
6975	The Cruise	An exceptional expose on a fascinating and inspiring individual.	2
6976	Inglourious Basterds	"For Brad Pitt's accent when speaking italian, and great actor Christopher Waltz that's a bingo.
I'm French and I think French actors in the movie were bad."	1
6977	Eros	Kar Wai Wong's part is the best. what a shakespearean way to tell the love and sexuality with a dress	2
6978	Green Book	Well crafted movie. Funny in places, poignant in places. Viggo's best acting. Awesome performance by Mahershala Ali. 	2
6979	Drive	Pacing issues with no actual character development. While the soundtrack is good, this can't carry the movie. Its just a rip off of Clint Eastwood's character with nothing new to add.	0
6980	Fast Five	"Loved the action/fight scenes. The races were pretty good. Pretty entertaining, especially Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson.

The only thing I found disappointing was the budding crush between Dom and a female officer (too easy). Minus that, this is good for a guy's night out."	2
6981	Salò, or The 120 Days Of Sodom	trash.	0
6982	Blade Runner 2049	Overly dark and dramatic, low on story line.	0
6983	Marley & Me	Treacle. And that's just the part before the dog dies.	0
6984	Dog Day Afternoon	While it starts out as a fairly light black comedy, Dog Day Afternoon quickly spirals into gripping suspense.	2
6985	Reis	P.S not watched.	1
6986	Watchmen	Horrible movie.	0
6987	Punch-Drunk Love	I really like it if I assume that everything after the door-kicking scene is the fantasy of Sandler's character - it's exactly what a man who doesn't view women as people would fantasize. But that's not supported within the film itself, so it's just a cardboard drama with no reason for the characters to act as they do.	0
6988	(500) Days of Summer	The perfect combination of good actors, good script, good music and the real life.	2
6989	An Inconvenient Truth	Would have liked it more if it wasn't a propoganda piece for Al gore, like he's the saviour of humanity. I also didn't give a shit for his personal life and his personal misfortunes, I don't see how that matters in the overall picture of humanity. I guess he's trying to fit into the mythical slot of Noah.. 	0
6990	The Dark Knight	this was a good movie... i watched it 3 times. but the face kinda freaked me out lol	2
6991	Armitage III: Poly Matrix	Cyberpunk anime about identity, prejudice and badass robots.	1
6992	Wild Tales	I wish more movies would be like this one. I won`t loose too many words on this one only watch it ! Watch it ! It is an epic movie.	0
6993	Russian Ark	Beautiful. I was honestly somewhat underwhelmed until the ending. The end of the ball, the departure of 'The European', the long procession to the exit, all so sad.	1
6994	Heat	Pointless subplots, niggas.	0
6995	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Would have been one of the best sci-fi's if the ending wasn't there. It just breaks everything about the movie.	0
6996	Harold and Maude	A must see.	2
6997	Tropic Thunder	i really only enjoyed robert downey, jr.  however, i enjoyed watching him so much that i give the movie a good rating because he is hilarious.	2
6998	Gladiator	Excellent, Excellent and Excellent, what a movie don't have words to describe superb 	2
6999	Four Lions	A very brave film which is ultimately flawed.	2
7000	The Fountain	I'm not the biggest Aronofsky fan out there, but this blew me away. One of my favorite films both of the year and, probably, ever.	2
7001	The End of the Tour	Segel really taps into the DFW I always imagined.  He nails the feeling of being sure of yourself, but unsure of how to present that to the world.  Eisenberg has fallen into the niche as the seemingly meek guy, who is (not-so-secretly) manipulating the people around him, but DFW's awareness of the situation creates an intense battle of wits between two individuals who respect each other so much they can't let down their guard.	2
7002	No Country for Old Men	the most unconventional addition to the thriller genre since film noir. Silent, brutal and surprising, like the two antagonists, this movie has no respect for action-, drama- or thriller-genre-specific standards, and thus keeps you engaged despite its slow speed and long runtime.	2
7003	Seraphim Falls	What starts off as a suspenseful thriller set in the post Civil War western US, ends up a philosophical head scratcher.  The unexpected turn isn't terrible, but it probably would have worked better if it had followed through on its original path.  However, I applaud the effort to stretch beyond its boundaries.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as it should have.	0
7004	Interstellar	MUUUUURF	1
7005	The Protector	gökhan tiryakinin hatrına 10. senaryo ve oyunculuk berbattı. diyaloglardan bahsetmicem zaten Türk sineması sessiz sinemaya dönse fena olmaz.	1
7006	This Is the End	Garbage. Pretends to be self-deprecating, but is actually rather smug and self-indulgent with its relentless mockery of religion and inside jokes. (Christians are real idiots, get it? Michael Cera is actually a nice guy! Get it?) Wow. This movie is just NOT funny and was painful to watch. The saddest part is the writers thought they were being clever when in reality the film was so dumb and self-obsessed it missed its own point. How's that for irony, Rogen? I'm embarrassed for everyone involved.	0
7007	Us	Hitchcock karşılaştırmaları vs. bu film için cidden komik. Hitchcock'un filmlerinin neredeyse tamamı, özünde aşk temalıdır, bu bambaşka bir şey. Slasher türüne de oldukça yakın ve olsa olsa John Carpenter, G. A. Romero veya erken dönem Sam Raimi sinemasıyla karşılaştırılabilir. Kör parmağım gözüne kısımları yok sayarsak, yer yer oldukça iyi, geren ve eğlenceli bir film olmuş. Get Out'tan daha iyi bir film. 	0
7008	Prometheus	Despite the parts that needed expanding, the characters that needed developing, and the equal amounts that shouldn't be there; I loved this. I'll stick my neck way out to be chopped off. This is an edgy, over-ambitious mess of a great film. 	0
7009	Pulp Fiction	the best movie as neo noir 	2
7010	13 Sins	it was good	2
7011	Hero	This movie combines art and adventure. Its just worth to see the movie because of the colors and settings. A true epic movie!	2
7012	Van Helsing	dull as dishwater and twice as flimsy	0
7013	Children of Men	Amazing story, incredible atmosphere and set pieces, best one-take scenes you've ever seen. 	2
7014	Once Upon a Time in Anatolia	NBC has talent about cinematography but his stories tells nothing. 	1
7015	Carnage	Großartiger Film, wenngleich nicht für den 0815-Kinobesucher geeignet. In einem Set so ein Dialogfeuerwerk abzubrennen ist mutig aber Polanski voll und ganz gelungen. Zu Christoph Waltz ist wohl schon alles gesagt, da reicht ein einfaches brilliant wohl mal aus.	2
7016	Unbreakable	For the fans of comics this is a must whatch	2
7017	Shaun of the Dead	dont stop me now	1
7018	The Ghost Writer	Somewhat simple in its storyline and it was easy to spot how it was going to end but not in an irritating way but in a relaxing and enjoyable fashion. The acting was ok. 	2
7019	Bad Boys II	Slightly drawn out, and at some points, delayed, but overall a good movie.  Will Smith was on cue with his usual one line quips.	1
7020	Trolls	Me agradó mucho y más las canciones que estaban bien situadas a lo largo de la película. El único problema es que ... Se debe ver en su idioma para entender algunas escenas cómicas.	1
7021	Moon	Great solo performance in a movie that reminds us of the great sci-fi films of old not only by its look but in quality.	2
7022	Pan's Labyrinth	Excellent movie, memorable scenes, great set and score and intricate story. Young girl enters a beautiful and mysterious world to escape her reality and sadistic stepfather during Spanish civil war.	2
7023	The Pursuit of Happyness	A sappy, sentimental drama. But it will get most people! In a good way. It is very hard to match the depth of feelings evoked in a father-son relationship as with ''Life is beautiful'', but this is modern and lighter. It works!	2
7024	True Romance	One of my all time favorites. Everything you could want in a film; love, romance, Walken, Hopper, Elvis, and machine guns.	2
7025	Spider-Man 3	This movie was way to busy. Scale back a few of the villians. Venom should have been a stand alone villian. Mary Janes story was the best arch in the movie.	0
7026	Touch of Evil	Dunday estes mee esposuh?	1
7027	Let the Right One In	One of the best of 2008 and up there with the best vampire movies. Isolation, the pain of growing up, alcoholism, family, vampirism ... all this is tied up in a very subtle way and creeps secretly up your spine and even hits you in the heart.	2
7028	The Hole	One of the best prison escape films I've ever seen. I never thought it would be so exciting to see a group of prisoners digging tunnels. The lack of music makes the film suspenseful and gives it a very realistic feel. I really had the feeling like I was there with the prisoners, and you really hope they succeed in digging the tunnel without the guards noticing. The ending was a shocker and I'm still in awe of it.	2
7029	Annihilation	Marked to remind myself i need to watch it a 2nd time to give a more accurate score. 	0
7030	The Bridge on the River Kwai	David Lean's precursor to Lawrence of Arabia is funny and is an amazing study of culture clash (British v. Japanese, British v. American).	2
7031	Exit Through the Gift Shop	So much truth in this film, regardless of fact.	1
7032	The Prestige	Probably the only movie I will ever give a perfect score.  Absolutely love this movie and the acting is absolutely amazing.  Great soundtrack, great story.  David Bowie as Tesla was a perfect cast.  	2
7033	The Notebook	ryan ryan	1
7034	Fight Club	When I fist saw the movie, it seemed a little thematically confused. It was on my second viewing that I realized that the movie wasn't a parable on modern civilization, it was simply a story about a man suffering from depression and insomnia. Great characters, sublime performances, inventive direction and incredibly stylish.	2
7035	The Blues Brothers	Jake Blues, just out from prison, puts together his old band to save the Catholic home where he and brother Elwood were raised. (imdb.com)	0
7036	The Prestige	Not quite Memento, not quite Amadeus, but quite enough to satisfy and entertain anyone looking for either. Nolan certainly knows how to make good twists (sans the very last one, perhaps) and keep anyone watching engrossed in its web of betrayal. Gets a bit weaker going into the third act when it jumps a bit too far out of logic, but remains its composure until the end.	2
7037	Misery	fantastic adaptation of the now classic stephen king novel with of the great female vilains of all time along with nurse ratched from one flew over the cuckoos nest.	2
7038	This Is the End	If I smoked funny things, I might have enjoyed it.	2
7039	The Incredibles	Beautifly animation	1
7040	Inception	The acting is insane and the story line is unique and original. 	2
7041	The Godfather: Part II	The presence of Robert de Niro as young Vito is awesome. Probably the best movie continuation.	2
7042	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Good action movie, fun to watch and moves along quick enough after the first half.	2
7043	Beethoven	-	1
7044	Sharknado	Where was Aquaman?	1
7045	Inception	this is the best  Drama, Sci-fi, Suspense/Thriller, Mystery movie I think	2
7046	Drive	stylish drivel	1
7047	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	film was perfect nevertheless it's slightly different than original novel. 	2
7048	Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, Sprocket Holes, Dirt Particles, Etc.	Well, it's certainly a descriptive title.  And the edge lettering pulses in a somewhat hypnotic way, but boy, I stopped watching after about 30 seconds, concluding that there were more important thins to do in life.	1
7049	Children of Men	astonishing	2
7050	Fireflies in the Garden	It was one of the most emotional movie i've seen . I love movies about family dramas and it was a wonderful example of that type of movies. The acting was very successful. Especially Julia Roberts was great an Oscar nomination is very possible for her .. And I loved pregnant Roberts she looks gorgeous. The cast deserves a SAG nomination. There're a lot of things I really loved about this movie ! 	2
7051	Inception	I truly can't think of a bad thing to say about this film, so totally awesome	2
7052	The Fifth Element	Great actors, great effects, a futuriste time, some great weapons, wonderfull vehicles and a great direction i don't need more to say.	2
7053	The Raid: Redemption	While video games like 'Heavy Rain' attempt to create the experience of an interactive movie, this movie seems to be the first-ever attempt at a non-interactive video game. A very bad video game! The only hint of story is the opening sequence, after that it is essentially one long, long fighting scene. The choreography is fine and the only reason why I don't give this movie a score of zero. But even that gets boring after the first 20 minutes. Frustrating and pointless!	0
7054	Tora! Tora! Tora!	Better than Pearl Harbor	0
7055	Suspiria	A masterfully filmed, haunting, at times cheesy but most of the time intense, operatic film with amazing psychedelic cinematography. Has nightmare-like qualities. Though the actual gore may seem dated and unrealistic, the murder scenes stay striking and powerful in their creative executions, the first one probably being one of the most intense ever filmed. One of the film's major highpoints is also the wonderful score by Italian prog rock band Goblin. Definetly worth a watch for horror fans.	2
7056	The Beat That My Heart Skipped	A fairly good film. Duris' character is nervous, intense, and hard to sympathize with - but played brilliantly nevertheless.	2
7057	Glengarry Glen Ross	Mostly boring and without any particularly likable characters.	0
7058	Her	"Good movie, emotional and relationship focused.

Follows a man who falls in love with his AI OS. Eventually it cheats on him and all this other crazy shit happens.

Rather implausible universe, which affects the overall experience."	2
7059	Mulholland Drive	no other movie made me THINK so much. no other made me FEEL so much.	0
7060	X-Men: Days of Future Past	I loved the use of time travel in this narrative - first time I saw it used in this way. Movie was a fun ride. 	2
7061	12:01 PM	" 12:01 WAS A PIECE OF SHIT COMPARED TO GROUNDHOG DAY

IT WAS THE COLLECTIVE TISSUE BOX OF SWEATY CUM STAINS AND YOU COULD SMELL THE NECKBEARD ON THAT MOVIE FROM A MILE AWAY, THE WRITERS CAN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CRAWL BACK INTO THE BASEMENT THEY CAME FROM"	0
7062	Blade Runner	I watched this movie 20 years ago,and I was little bit confused.Last year I read the book.The book is great! I am a big SF fan,and the book is one of the best SF books that I read in my life.So,few days ago I wanted to return to the film adaptation.And I am dissapointed once again...I like only Vangelis music and that's it.The essence from the book is not in the movie,a lot of scenes and characters from the book are missing...it's like a total disaster...I hope that you will read the book...	0
7063	Goodfellas	Scorsese is in top-form,creating the best gangster film ever.Everything in this film,from the actors,to the cinematography,to the editing,to the script,to the great use of music is just perfect.	2
7064	Dirty Dancing	even if i find some parts of it funny, i enjoyed it	2
7065	Final Destination	John Denver... Died in a plane crash...	1
7066	Dunkirk	Not Good for Nolan, Just a story with things happening. Plot is not interesting	0
7067	Permanent Vacation	Awesome Lower East Side location work, New York as a post armageddon interzone full of junkie squalor crazies, which is handy, as the film itself is boring small scale wanderlust.	2
7068	Memento	really liked this film a lot. a film you must watch more than once. great cast and direction by chris nolan. 	2
7069	Star Trek: The Motion Picture	There are parts of this film I absolutely love, but for the most part is it an extremely slow moving exposition on the exterior of space ships. If you ever need footage of the original Enterprise, this is the film to queue up.	0
7070	Gerry	 I gave this a 2 simply because of the dirt pillow conversation.  Other than that it was the most boring movie I have ever seen, too bad they couldn't have made better use of really good camera work.	0
7071	The Silence of the Lambs	One of the best movies ever made. If you like thriller it is a must see movie.	2
7072	Watchmen	watchmen is the great science-fiction and social psychology movie, for last years its the effective one of a few films for me.	2
7073	Logan	Overlong, overly violent and overrated.	0
7074	Glory	Interesting topic (even for european) with comic-book characters that ruin the effort of drama.	2
7075	Water	A wonderful satire.	2
7076	The Matrix	I was amazed as I saw it the first time the spring of 1999... not sure if it would bring about the same effect 10 years later	1
7077	Sonbahar	daim yusuf orti 	1
7078	Inception	The concept and concept art is the perfect. Its quite cool designed. Hans Zimmer made the soundtracks, They are very very cool : 	2
7079	The Matrix	there is no spoon...	0
7080	Dark Shadows	"Really weak! I was able to predict the next scene each time. 
Probably good for kids though"	0
7081	Pulp Fiction	As films go this is sheer class and should be on everybodies must watch list, provided you enjoy a bit of violence and don't mind a bit of bad lanuage. 	2
7082	Alien: Covenant	Stupid people do stupid decisions and die stupidly. I gave it 35 score only for the following: 1. It's in my favorite franchise - I think there is no better horror idea that Alien Xenomorph by Giger. And Alien is present, even not in final form. 2. Android is great, even with all this gay shit. 3. Idea about humans&gods&robots&creators/etc. That's all folks. I hope next movie won't be such a B-movie. 	2
7083	Fight Club	this is a great movie! had to turn away alot from pain...	2
7084	Swiss Army Man	Loses its edge instantly. Feels like it was written stream-of-consciousness by an angsty teenage boy. 	0
7085	The Big Lebowski	Dude!	1
7086	Ghost Town	Liked it! Don't expect anything drama or very keen humour and the ending is a bit too much morality, but still. Good sunday afternoon fun.	2
7087	Suicide Squad	I watch this movie twice in cinema, even though im a big fan of Batman and it changes since Affleck but i must say Suicide Squad is like what most article said. It wasn't as good as what you expected but wasn't as bad as what you hear. 	2
7088	Braveheart	funny (not intentionally), historically wrong, 	1
7089	The Wolf of Wall Street	This is my favorite movie ever	2
7090	Avengers: Infinity War	Does superhero well but is still superhero	1
7091	Planet of the Apes	An abomination. Don't bother, just re-watch the original. Or any of the 4 sequels. Even the TV show is better than this. In fact, the cartoon's better than this.	0
7092	Blade Runner 2049	In this movie we're going in a literally dystopic world. In every scenes we're feeling that worlds ambiance. Also Blade Runner 2049 shows to us distinctly  Auteur  director concept.	1
7093	Eighth Grade	Movie about ugly, stupid teen trying to be cool. Watching it was awkward and boring... Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen	0
7094	Hobo with a Shotgun	a perfect exploitation grindhouse themed movie	2
7095	The Stoning of Soraya M.	This compelling and emotional movie represents what occurs all too often in some Islamic countries.	2
7096	Maniac	Probably the grisliest and meanest movie I have ever seen. Thoroughly disgusting atmosphere. 	2
7097	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Another Spielberg letdown... Skip if you can	0
7098	Mad Max: Fury Road	Non-stop action. I really enjoyed the color scheme of the environment and attention to detail in costumes and makeup that really helped enrich the cinematography. Plot and back story was weaker but it didn't take away from the experience for me.  	2
7099	Air Bud	It changed my life.	1
7100	Freddy Got Fingered	First movie I returned after watching it for 30 minutes.	0
7101	Rope	One of Hitchcock's best. Riveting.	2
7102	L.A. Confidential	Excellent film noir !!!  Great Action !!!  If only Jennifer Connely was in the movie.	2
7103	The Limey	Maybe it's because I'm British, but the cockney rhyming slang explanations get rather tedious.	0
7104	The Matrix	Great and innovative movie. 	2
7105	The Curse of the Were-Rabbit	Such a fab film! Well done music track and cute characters. 'Course of...' is film not only for children but for all families!	2
7106	The Perfume of the Lady in Black	"Francesco Barilli says: horror movies never make any sense. this movie is a proof. Nightmares, cerebral madness, visions, filled with morbid style. 
"	0
7107	The Duchess	Great soundtrack   and costumes.	2
7108	Predators	A movie with some surprisingly good entertaining parts. Adrian Brody is weirdly cast as the muscular hero, the supporting cast do a good job, particularly Topher Grace 	2
7109	Memento	Brilliant psychological thriller. If you like it, do check out Nolan's previous film, Following, a Hitchcock-esque B&W feature.	2
7110	The Thing	was the great one of john carpenter's Gems Creature facts Nicely done on all levels classic horror at its peak 	2
7111	The Silence of the Lambs	THTHTHTHTHTTHTH	1
7112	A Star Is Born	sucked me in. great performances and outstanding music.	2
7113	Prom Night	Damn shit movie. Worse movie I think I've ever seen, and I've seen some terrible ones. The characters were both unbelievable and unlikable. The acting was horrid. The plot was unexplainable and horribly predictable. Even the terrible original was better than this hunk of shit.	0
7114	Dances with Wolves	boring	0
7115	Midsommar	Echoes of Wickerman. In some ways better, in some ways worse. I would have preferred to come away with a clearer picture of the communities world view, and of how this extreme vision of community contrasts with the selfish individualism of the outsiders.	0
7116	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Scott Pilgram must fight through the league of evil Ex's, which consists of 8 people, to win over the girl of his dreams. Plus this movie made me feel like I was on acid.  	2
7117	Rat Race	Shitty version of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World	1
7118	Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan	KKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!	1
7119	Toy Story	This movie is truly a work of art, an was a lauching pad for cgi animation. 	2
7120	Annihilation	It has Natalie Portman, but it's also wierd as fuck.	1
7121	Zack and Miri Make a Porno	Momentami smieszny, ale ogolnie bez sensu i dosc oblesny.	1
7122	Wind River	Warning: this is a **very** intense, violent movie that's extremely well done.  	2
7123	The Sound of Music	I grew up with this movie and it gets better every year. Love the music and story. It's such an uplifting movie and it brightens my day everytime I watch it. Love Julie Andrews!	2
7124	The Disaster Artist	not a comedy but pretty funny	2
7125	Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade	The second best entry in the Indiana Jones series, this one is great fun, but lacks any real sense of wonder and dread that the first film had. It still has a bit of Spielberg smarm, but the action sequences and chemistry between Connery and Ford make it a classic.	2
7126	Foodfight	fuck armageddon this is hell	0
7127	Napoleon Dynamite	I don't like being expected to laugh at how mind-numbingly dumb the characters are.	0
7128	Feud	1. Season	2
7129	Tsotsi	Pure sappy crap. It comes as no surprise that Academy voters would gobble this up and award it the Foreign Language Oscar.	0
7130	The Artist	Charming.  	2
7131	Surf Nazis Must Die	THIS... MOVIE... IS... BORING!	0
7132	Lost in Translation	The most boring film ever.	0
7133	Dune	Sort of a guilty pleasure I guess.	0
7134	The Sixth Sense	you would never guess	1
7135	Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus	That shark jumping was the only scene worth watching.	0
7136	Jurassic Park	I watch it every year, over and over again. It remainds me of the times, when dinosaures were important part of my life (my childhood) and they were just AWESOME. Great flick.	2
7137	Leaving Las Vegas	I had to search on the internet if alcoholism can really become this terrible. The most depressing part of the movie is that the answer is yes.	0
7138	Kanal-i-zasyon	Turk televizyolarina yapıilmis eglenceli bir elestiri.	1
7139	Midsommar	I would consider this movie not to be a horror film, but a guide to superior living conditions.  The murder rate of this town is FAR lower than the murder rate of christians as a whole (i.e. which hunts, sexual persecution, disabled/retard persecution(nazis,which hunts, etc., etc...), racism, general discrimination, holocausts, crusades, etc... etc... etc... a never ending unbroken chain of hate, intolerance, and murder).	0
7140	Dallas Buyers Club	Who said that you can't buy some extra days of one's life. Movies like these teach us to never give up the will to live. Don't forget it's our life, so lets fight for it.	2
7141	The Godfather	Great ... Who am i to criticize this masterpiece	2
7142	Jack Reacher: Never Go Back	Too much cliche in dialogues. Worse than the first one...	0
7143	Citizen Kane	Expected this to be hard work. So many people say things like - I can see that it's great but it's not very enjoyable. That's rubbish. Citizen Kane is energetic, engrossing and Orson Welles is just so watchable.	2
7144	Fight Club	A bit overrated but it is still a fantastic movie.  Fincher is incredibly talented and even though this isn't his best it is a must see for any Fincher fan.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are very good in this as well.  It is also better than the book. 	2
7145	Brideshead Revisited	This film is visually stunning, however the plot and character development lack depth. Watching it was more like viewing a great painting than hearing a great story. 	2
7146	Inception	great movie!	2
7147	United 93	"Very few films these day carry a true emotional punch. Most emotions are forced onto us, some are layered with a heavy hand. Not so with united 93. Those who can vividly remember the events of 9/11, no matter where they were in the world, will know the shock and disbelief they felt. The problem with the tragic events was that it was predictable that Hollywood would get its hands on the day that changed the world. Enter Paul Greengrass.

Mr Greengrass is a blazing talent that has made his name "	2
7148	Never Let Me Go	Bleek and evocative. This movie leaves you thinking about life hard.	2
7149	Master of the Flying Guillotine	This move has had a huge influence on many modern video games and films (the Street Fighter video game, the Kill Bill films).  If you love kung-fu movies see this.	2
7150	Stand by Me	Second favorite movie	0
7151	Never Let Me Go	Keira Knightly & Carey Mulligan shined, ravishing romance, discreet.	2
7152	Sunrise	"Let's get this out of the way: this was made in 1927. It features several repetitious, slow-paced sequences and a few impressively hamm-y performances.

WIth that said, Sunrise is almost certainly the best silent film ever made. It is a one of the great film achievements of all time, and undoubtedly among the most cinematographically influential. Even a very modern-biased critic such as myself has to admit this is damn good movie."	2
7153	The Truman Show	Anyone who gave this film a 70 or below, has no idea what they are talking about. This is a true masterpiece. 	0
7154	The Colony	Horribly sexist.	0
7155	The Birth of a Nation	The importance of this film can NOT be understated. It is the precursor to all modern Hollywood films. While its subject matter is reprehensible, its greatness is in its technical breakthroughs. While its not a film to shown to impressionable children, it is of inestimable value to anyone who wishes to understand the art of filmmaking.	2
7156	Jackie Brown	While there is no such thing as a perfect film, for me this is as close as it gets.  Jackie Brown is endlessly watchable, with an unexpectedly amazing cast, a huge amount of great dialogue, and not a boring moment in its over 2 1/2 hours.  I notice something new every time I watch this movie, and I look forward to watching it many more times.	2
7157	Titanic	o-ver-ra-ted	1
7158	Gladiator	grate story 	1
7159	Annabelle: Creation	Overall, as a movie in itself it's just okay, but when thought of in context as the kind of movie it is, it's pretty good.	2
7160	Alien	"1979......
a film that was just ahead of it's time, if you made it now it would be all cgi and blue screen effects all over the shop. Just simply has to be one of the top ten films of the last 50 years.
"	2
7161	Little Miss Sunshine	It's like a Wes Anderson movie. Disfunctional, but funny family. Love'em. Another great one is Birds of America.	2
7162	The Notebook	Overflowing with needless, sickening sentimentality, yanking on your heartstrings repeatedly and hoping for a response. There is worthwhile acting and a modicum of story, but its intentions are so base and its attitude to the audience so unrefined that one can't help but feel almost insulted.	2
7163	The Blues Brothers	Fantastic cult classic. A real fun ride.	2
7164	Never Let Me Go	It's a gorgeous movie when it comes to the shots, setting, and general ambiance. But it never lives up to the book. While the book felt very close and personal, the movie doesn't even come close to that and is overall very detached. It is only saved by the moving performance of Carey Mulligan. I dislike how they changed some of the bits from the book, such as it being Ruth who finds Kathy hugging the pillow instead of Madame.	0
7165	Léon: The Professional	Fantastic. And Natalie Portman's best performance I've seen.	2
7166	Swept Away	If this were not a remake, it would maybe get a higher score.  Alas, it is, and it gets a Stay Away score.   Not that the the original was a masterpiece, just really good, but it had better actors, a better director, better photography, and an original concept.  Do you really have to endure madonna just to spare yourself a few subtitles?	0
7167	No Country for Old Men	Strong! Hard to watch at times but it really grabs you.	2
7168	Gåten Ragnarok	One part Indiana Jones, one part Jurassic Park and one part Plan 9 From Outer Space.	1
7169	AVP: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem	Who cares? Only plus, it had more gore than the last pile of crap.	0
7170	Planet of the Apes	An abomination. Don't bother, just re-watch the original. Or any of the 4 sequels. Even the TV show is better than this. In fact, the cartoon's better than this.	0

7175	Maniac	Probably the grisliest and meanest movie I have ever seen. Thoroughly disgusting atmosphere. 	2
7176	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Another Spielberg letdown... Skip if you can	0
7177	Mad Max: Fury Road	Non-stop action. I really enjoyed the color scheme of the environment and attention to detail in costumes and makeup that really helped enrich the cinematography. Plot and back story was weaker but it didn't take away from the experience for me.  	2
7178	Air Bud	It changed my life.	1
7179	Interstellar	a perfect masterpiece	2
7180	Goodfellas	best mob movie ever!	2
7181	Amadeus	I really liked this at the time, but then I am a piano teacher and was very keen on all things Mozart in the 80s!	2
7182	Persona	"80
"	1
7183	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	I got nothing to say but awesome.	2
7184	Enemy	simply unnerving, demands your every thought.	2
7185	Accepted	This is a hilarious movie with a lot of unexpected things happening. You won't stop laughing during this whole movie. A must see for everyone. Especially those people that applied to colleges but didn't get in.	2
7186	Beverly Hills Cop	this is the best film	2
7187	Dallas Buyers Club	same old American film. acting was good, content is boring, all other things good. not a worst film in the world. deserve to watch once.	0
7188	The Bourne Identity	Pretty good action but boring at some times...	2
7189	X-Men Origins: Wolverine	This movie was lame.	0
7190	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	tarantinoesque good movie :)	2
7191	Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice	Quite a Dark-Knight imitation	1
7192	Taxi Driver	Adventure and suspense; classic performance and unforgettable characters 	2
7193	Before Sunrise	i like the idea but this conversations is completely idiotic and cliche	0
7194	Last Life in the Universe	Amazing soundtrack.	2
7195	Pee-wee's Big Adventure	Tim Burton's only legitimately great movie. Timeless, classic.	2
7196	The Goonies	classic	2
7197	Smokin' Aces	A little too over-the-top for its own good.  Another film trying too hard to be Lock Stock.  Stupid ending. 	0
7198	Gamer	this movie was just so increibly bad and sterotypical, its like a 13 year old couterstriker fan made it And my eyes still hurt, there was nearly never one second without 3 cut scenes, strobes or flickering	0
7199	The Raid: Redemption	I actually don't like action movies that much and I thought I would have been bored to death during the film, but it's proven all wrong. Even though there is a miniscule story-plot, I've enjoyed The Raid so much. The fighting scenes are very impressing and ballet-like and I actually don't think it 's more violent than a Hollywood action movie. (Soundtrack is also a bonus)	2
7200	Annihilation	Mantık hatalarıyla dolu berbat bir film. Güzelim senaryo güzelim bütçe çöp olmuş.	1
7201	Bride Wars	ok, I laughed at International Butter Club but that's about all this movie has going for it. Every character in this is a horrible person.	2
7202	The Adventures of Tintin	Yes it's incredibly pretty and high-action, but this is not the Tintin spirit I've seen in the comics or the animated series. Why not keep what made him unique? Taken on its own, I'll have to admit it's at least a decent adventure movie.	2
7203	A Clockwork Orange	 Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is widely misunderstood us a vindication of violence as oppose to what it truly is a satire of it. One is not supposed to empathize with Alex, one is actually supposed to be revolted by his actions. If the the film seems sympathetic toward Alex it's only because it is told through his voice. Your supposed to be upset by the images on screen. It is also a commentary on the state of criminal rehabilitation and how the system consistently fails at it.	0
7204	Twin Peaks	My favorite TV series of all time.	2
7205	Evan Almighty	Pleasantly surprised.Was a litlle scared because of the plethora of bad reviews. It was fairly entertaining though without being funny through means of stupidity(ala- Will Ferrell or Jim Carey)	2
7206	La La Land	A lovable tale with a warming soundtrack and cinematography to melt the mind. It may be Oscar bait but it's presentation is warming and nostalgic. 	2
7207	Winter's Bone	 It's a very good film with several great performances from Jennifer Lawrence, John Hawkes and Dale Dickey. It's not exactly a happy movie and I'm not sure I am up for revisiting it for awhile.	2
7208	Joker	Perdede	1
7209	Gurotesuku	Like japanese porn without the japanese porn, but with pubes. Als it should have a more of a Takeshi's castle element to it.	1
7210	Slumdog Millionaire	Despite the acclaim and obvious mainstream appeal, this film is riddled with plot holes and laughable twists. Enjoyed it as you do many films without exactly rating it highly.	2
7211	The Bucket List	I knew I was in for a good movie with the likes of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in it but after watching the movie I was at awe. A treat of a movie!! It is about this two terminally ill patients, very different from each other but then they decide to spend the last moments of their life together during which they heal each other. It is all about finding the true joy in life . I guess it comes highly recommended. 	2
7212	The Godfather: Part III	Not as good as the first one, but still a great conclusion of this epic trilogy.	2
7213	Frankenstein Meets the Spacemonster	this is about as bad as you're going to get - I don't know how you good possibly make a crummier movie?	0
7214	Se7en	At times, a bit gross. High on the list of suspense movies.	2
7215	All About Lily Chou-Chou	Beautiful film. Salyu and Kobayashi really came through on the soundtrack end of things. The timeline is just a tad confusing on a first run through.	2
7216	John Dies at the End	Zany and fun for the first half but continued to die down as things started to make more sense. 	2
7217	Home Alone	One of the best Christmas movies and stll makes me laugh even though I have seen it several times.	2
7218	Crash	I don't know what anyone saw in this movie.  It was very boring and it sucked.	0
7219	Buffalo '66	"Holy shit, this is like the film I've been wanting to make my whole life.
Kind of like if Cassavetes directed Punch-Drunk Love, or something. I applaud Vincent for having the cajones to make this film, it's really the kind of film that will only resonate with a small select group of people, but when it does the film is like a godsend.
One of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. I would have ended it differently though..."	2
7220	The Godfather	Don Corleone losses his elder son and is attacked by rival gang...in this condition, his other son takes the charge and comes in command.he starts punishing the people who killed his brother and attacked his father. With the course of time, he becomes 'The Godfather'	2
7221	Tropic Thunder	If you've ever worked in theater, you will totally know all of these characters! This movie was hilarious, and really a joy to watch. I won't say Oscars, but it was a really good time at the cinema. 	2
7222	Farewell, My Queen	More of a fascinating study of obsession than a detailed examination of the fall of Marie Antoinette. Great performances, and quietly rapturous. 	2
7223	Happy Feet	Entirely too long and too politically conscious.	0
7224	The Scorpion King	OK ***	1
7225	Christmas Vacation	It didn't age well and Chevy Chase is a dick.	1
7226	The Notebook	Absolutely beautiful film - intriguing story pulls you right in!	2
7227	Alien	Sigourney Weaver... hellyeah, HR Giger, Hellyeah.... my arse was kicked by this film, and still manages to do so now.	1
7228	Contact	"better to be watched or re-watched after reading carl sagan's novel, demon haunted world.
"	1
7229	The Blues Brothers	the Christmas Day family ritual!  A classic!	2
7230	The Sting	The quintessential heist-movie. 	2
7231	The Fault in Our Stars	okay? okay 	2
7232	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind	just - perfect	2
7233	The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers	The bridge film in the trilogy and as such does not stand alone as well as Fellowship or ROTK. But that said, it is still brilliant, with a brilliant turn by Andy Serkis, who can't be praised enough for bringing Gollum to life. 	2
7234	Fair Game	Engrossing thanks to Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, but many elements don't elevate beyond adequate.	2
7235	The Interview	An incredibly tense film with a wonderful script and great performances. Amazing considering its low budget and the fact the action mostly takes place in one room.	2
7236	Obyknovennyy fashizm	It's not a Mondo's but a very detailled documentary.	2
7237	Mulholland Drive	Crap, crap, crap. I can't see what everybody finds about this movie.	0
7238	Prisoners	"A truly great modern thriller.
 "	2
7239	Midsommar	I really liked the aesthetics of this movie, but I just don't like realistic gore. It's disturbing.	2
7240	Divergent	was expecting an intelligent and dark dystopian future film, instead got a teenage coming of age / romance.	1
7241	The Hunt	An intense nightmarish drama. Some people have said the plot has holes, is stupid or unrealistic. Personally i thought it all seemed plausible from start to finish.   There's been increasing discussion about sexual abuse in society and the importance of believing victims since proof of such abuse is exceedingly rare. This film paints a scenario of what could happen if we do drop due process. Many men do shy away from working with children for fear of something like this happening. 	2
7242	Moulin Rouge!	Music annoyed me. 	0
7243	Moonrise Kingdom	"Moonrise Kingdom reinvigorates its audience with the idea of love and touches the child in all of us, making us remember what it's like to have an extreme child-like devotion to something or someone.
Another incredible snapshot of a believably bizzarre world comes straight from the mind of director Wes Anderson, Moonrise Kingdom seems like it's straight out of a New England Tourism catalogue while simultaneously being devoted to nowhere in particular. It's the sweetest movie you'll see all year"	2
7244	Grave of the Fireflies	Beautiful, but the saddest film I've ever seen.	1
7245	The Big Lebowski	92	1
7246	Tucker & Dale vs Evil	Interesting premise, and nice casting with Labine and Tudyk. It has a few funny moments, but it feels very repetitive, which is a big failure for such a short film. It's a shame, this had potential.	0
7247	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Original, different, stripbook style movie	2
7248	Requiem for a Dream	One of the most memorable scores I can remember, but I wasn't very keen on the pacing, acting, or script. Resides in mediocrity.	0
7249	The Nightmare Before Christmas	favorite	2
7250	Major Payne	loved it, hilarious	2
7251	Laura	My favorite film noir of all time is The Killers with Burt Lancaster and the gorgeous Eva Gardner.  But Laura has got to the be my second favorie.  Gene Tierney is hot and Dana Andrews is so perfect as the detective.  	2
7252	Signs	With few special effects for a sci-fi movie, Signs is highly effective at building suspense and creating Hitchcock-style, heart pounding moments.	2
7253	Audition	Compelling,  fluid,  ravenous colour 	2
7254	Prometheus	"trailer is good but movie sucks, i am scifi movie book everything lover but this movie look like teenage party gone wrong type cheap movie

first half start good and then script being shit"	1
7255	The Star Wars Holiday Special	Yikes!	1
7256	X-Men Origins: Wolverine	Yeah, it's the X-men, and that's kinda cool. Otherwise, not much by way of plot, lame characterization, and a movie that tried to pack way too much into its two hours.  Go read a graphic novel instead.	1
7257	Children of Men	It just wasn't... incredible, awesome, or anything like that. It was simply good. The awkward pacing didn't help either.	0
7258	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Get ready to cry.	1
7259	Pandorum	Surprisingly good.  I think that the movie was well written with all almost no loose ends.  Some of the science was questionable but that's universally true for all sci fi movies.  As a space survival movie, I enjoyed it quite a bit and was totally satisfied with the rental.	2
7260	Rope	One of Hitchcock's best. Riveting.	2
7261	L.A. Confidential	Excellent film noir !!!  Great Action !!!  If only Jennifer Connely was in the movie.	2
7262	The Limey	Maybe it's because I'm British, but the cockney rhyming slang explanations get rather tedious.	0
7263	The Matrix	Great and innovative movie. 	2
7264	The Curse of the Were-Rabbit	Such a fab film! Well done music track and cute characters. 'Course of...' is film not only for children but for all families!	2
7265	The Perfume of the Lady in Black	"Francesco Barilli says: horror movies never make any sense. this movie is a proof. Nightmares, cerebral madness, visions, filled with morbid style. 
"	0
7266	The Duchess	Great soundtrack   and costumes.	2
7267	Predators	A movie with some surprisingly good entertaining parts. Adrian Brody is weirdly cast as the muscular hero, the supporting cast do a good job, particularly Topher Grace 	2
7268	Memento	Brilliant psychological thriller. If you like it, do check out Nolan's previous film, Following, a Hitchcock-esque B&W feature.	2
7269	Wild Tales	her hikayede oldukça sürükleyici az zamanda hıkayelerın ıcıne  alıp o gergınlıge sokup sonra  daha bi oh demeden yenı bır gergınlıge koyması szifron'un ellerinden öptürür.	0
7270	Serenity	THE BEST FLICK EVER MORE WATCHED BY MY WIFE & I THAN ANY OTHER	2
7271	Ted	Formulaic but fun film from Seth MacFarlane.  Features the same type of humor as his other work and features gags at a rapid pace utilizing toilet humor, sex, drugs and MacFarlane's obsessions like Star Wars.  	2
7272	Dangerous Liaisons	I thought this movie was great, I loved the cruel and unusual ways in which Meretuil and Valmont seemed to love and hate each other at the same time. Suspenseful, dangerous, brilliant, a wicked wild and daring new spin on the classic tale of love and betrayal. Close and Malkovich make a great seductive pair, and the always sexy Michelle Pfeiffer gives a tender performence in a film that soars and shocks.	2
7273	Bee Movie	Loved it!  It asks the viewer to make some strange leaps in logic (like why all of a sudden the human population accepts the fact that bees can talk), but it's very Seinfieldesque in that way.  	2
7274	Up	Great first half, extremely disappointing second half.	2
7275	Divergent	was expecting an intelligent and dark dystopian future film, instead got a teenage coming of age / romance.	1
7276	The Hunt	An intense nightmarish drama. Some people have said the plot has holes, is stupid or unrealistic. Personally i thought it all seemed plausible from start to finish.   There's been increasing discussion about sexual abuse in society and the importance of believing victims since proof of such abuse is exceedingly rare.

7279	Grave of the Fireflies	Beautiful, but the saddest film I've ever seen.	1
7280	Let the Right One In	Far better than the US remake.	2
7281	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	I have only a very small handful of movies that I feel have lived up to their literary beginnings. This is definitely in the ranks. At the end my stomach dropped, thinking..I CAN'T wait a year to take this up again!	2
7282	The Fountainhead	This movie has smoldering sexual themes. Both Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper give the best performances of their careers. Uses beautiful architecture as a theme and as part of the message. Heavy on a controversial philosophical point of view. I find a movie from that era so firmly focused on philosophy unusual and very enjoyable.	2
7283	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	The best movie of all time.A sci-fi masterpiece,Arnie at his best,Cameron's direction and special effects excellent... 	2
7284	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Perhaps my favorite movie of all time.	2
7285	Mulholland Drive	I feel like I'm watching a masterpiece, but I have no idea what's going on in it.	0
7286	Kung Fu Panda	Funny!!!!!	2
7287	Se7en	ending is among the most badass film moments 	2
7288	Jason Bourne		1
7289	Mamma Mia!	"Funniest movie I've seen in years!!! Absolutely fantastic!
 "	2
7290	Rififi	Dassin's fatalistic heist thriller features one of cinema's finest moments; the breath-taking central robbery scene. It would, however, do the film a horrible injustice to solely focus on that, in the process pushing aside its most enduring quality, a deeply affecting story of inevitability, an unavoidable march towards doom.	2
7291	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	Fun, and strange at times. 	2
7292	Garfield	AHHHHH WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN	0
7293	Dark Star	Strange movie. Some will hate it others really enjoy it.	0
7294	The Thing	Carpenter's best film? No doubt about it. He hasn't made a film of this caliber again, and even the Horror genre, as a whole,  hasn't seen a film of such ferocity and tension since The Thing. 	0
7295	The Swimmer	A lot of things about this are off.  The music is heavy-handed and creepy.  Lancaster is not vulnerable enough for the role.  The direction is dated.  The dialogue is writerly.  Yet, there is still something about this enigmatic journey that is worth watching --- once. 	2
7296	Requiem for a Dream	Overrated	1
7297	Shotgun Stories	A little slow at the beginning but builds the suspense nicely and I appreciated the realism. Well worth a look.	2
7298	X-Men: Days of Future Past	I loved the use of time travel in this narrative - first time I saw it used in this way. Movie was a fun ride. 	2
7299	12:01 PM	" 12:01 WAS A PIECE OF SHIT COMPARED TO GROUNDHOG DAY

IT WAS THE COLLECTIVE TISSUE BOX OF SWEATY CUM STAINS AND YOU COULD SMELL THE NECKBEARD ON THAT MOVIE FROM A MILE AWAY, THE WRITERS CAN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CRAWL BACK INTO THE BASEMENT THEY CAME FROM"	0
7300	Zelig	I have to admit. I only saw 30 minutes of the film and got bored. I thought it a great idea, but the jokes are not funny in my opinion (at least in these 30 minutes). I will probably try another day.	0
7301	Juno	Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. If you like that song you also like this lovely movie.	2
7302	Pride & Prejudice	Not normally the kind of movie I'd see, but I really liked it.	2
7303	The Truman Show	This is one of the most MOVING and symbolic movies I've ever seen.  Jim Carrey's vulnerability and determination as the truth unfolds is at once heart-breaking and inspiring.  This movie truly touched me.  	2
7304	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom	Not much new. Great action near the end, but don't expect to be thrilled by the story, just the special effects and the scares in the last 30 minutes. There is also some well placed humor	2
7305	Aliens	brilliant!!!!	2
7306	Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!	One of the worst movies I've ever seen! Pure garbage!	0
7307	And Now for Something Completely Different	Worthless if you've seen Flying Circus, as the execution and delivery in this film is considerably worse than it is in the series. Only for obsessives, or people who have never seen Flying Circus.	0
7308	Dracula	Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider drag down an otherwise great retelling of Bram Stoker's classic book.	0
7309	Water Babies		1
7310	The Shining	This film would have been very good, had I not read the book beforehand. The book was so brilliant that this adaptation paled in comparison, and the changes made to the plot seemed unnecessary.	0
7311	Fireflies in the Garden	It was one of the most emotional movie i've seen . I love movies about family dramas and it was a wonderful example of that type of movies. The acting was very successful. Especially Julia Roberts was great an Oscar nomination is very possible for her .. And I loved pregnant Roberts she looks gorgeous. The cast deserves a SAG nomination. There're a lot of things I really loved about this movie ! 	2
7312	Inception	I truly can't think of a bad thing to say about this film, so totally awesome	2
7313	The Fifth Element	Great actors, great effects, a futuriste time, some great weapons, wonderfull vehicles and a great direction i don't need more to say.	2
7314	The Raid: Redemption	While video games like 'Heavy Rain' attempt to create the experience of an interactive movie, this movie seems to be the first-ever attempt at a non-interactive video game. A very bad video game! The only hint of story is the opening sequence, after that it is essentially one long, long fighting scene. The choreography is fine and the only reason why I don't give this movie a score of zero. But even that gets boring after the first 20 minutes. Frustrating and pointless!	0
7315	Tora! Tora! Tora!	Better than Pearl Harbor	0
7316	Suspiria	A masterfully filmed, haunting, at times cheesy but most of the time intense, operatic film with amazing psychedelic cinematography. Has nightmare-like qualities. Though the actual gore may seem dated and unrealistic, the murder scenes stay striking and powerful in their creative executions, the first one probably being one of the most intense ever filmed. One of the film's major highpoints is also the wonderful score by Italian prog rock band Goblin. Definetly worth a watch for horror fans.	2
7317	The Beat That My Heart Skipped	A fairly good film. Duris' character is nervous, intense, and hard to sympathize with - but played brilliantly nevertheless.	2
7318	Glengarry Glen Ross	Mostly boring and without any particularly likable characters.	0
7319	Her	"Good movie, emotional and relationship focused.

Follows a man who falls in love with his AI OS. Eventually it cheats on him and all this other crazy shit happens.

Rather implausible universe, which affects the overall experience."	2
7320	Blood Diamond	This is my absolute favorite movie	0
7321	Iron Man 3	So it's played for laughs a bit too much to be a 'serious' super-hero movie but, unlike many other comic actioners, it's sharp enough to entertain, nearly all the way to the end. The lack of jeopardy- particularly in the final messy action sequence- diminishes its weight, but (after the plodding IM2) the switch in tone to laugh-out-loud romp is successful in my book.	2
7322	Hacksaw Ridge	I actually had a conversation with Desmond T. Doss Jr. and he said this movie was completely accurate to what his father told him. Amazing! 	2
7323	Unbreakable	An M. Night to remember!  Unbreakable is more enjoyable with each viewing.  Subtle and layered, the depth of this thriller makes it Shyamalin's best to date.  Arguably, Bruce Willis' finest performance.	2
7324	The Matrix	great movie one of the best of all time 	2
7325	Dawn of the Dead	If you've ever been drawn to visit the mall without being sure why, SEE THIS MOVIE!	0
7326	Gladiator	This movie has everything. 	1
7327	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	An insanely fun visual ride with a touching romance story that makes you care about not so good people. Edgar Wright's perfect representation of a comic book. 	2
7328	Let the Right One In	Haunting, beautiful, thought provoking and original, incredible cinematography. This is modern independent cinema at its very best. 	2
7329	Amy's Orgasm	worst movie ever my moms name is amy	0
7330	Insidious: Chapter 2	sesle izleyici korkutmak, sinema değildir.	1
7331	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	Love, Love, Love it. My kind of movie.	2
7332	Shaun of the Dead	94	1
7333	No Country for Old Men	http://kimisfansfilmtavsiyeleri.blogspot.com/2013/05/no-country-for-old-men-2007.html	1
7334	Guardians of the Galaxy	Fena değil, komik, yan karakterler başarılı. Klasik amerikan filmi geyiklerinden nasibini almış.	1
7335	Let the Right One In	Simply my favorite movie, and one of the best films ever made	2
7336	The Prestige	   abracadabra 	1
7337	Citizen Duane	This was a really good film, it didn't have a lot of boring parts in it and the humor was subtle but hilarious.  Watch it if you haven't.	2
7338	The Passion of Anna	A masterpiece of Cinema.	2
7339	The Iron Lady	disgusting	0
7340	Monsters, Inc.	Great animation and story from Pixar	2
7341	Limitless	My expectations for this film were pretty high and sadly it didn't live up to them. It was a good storyline and a great idea but it just didn't work for me. I didn't like the ending at all. (The alternative ending in the extras on the DVD wasn't bad.)	0
7342	Inception	An innovative exploration of how complex and multifaceted the human mind can be. Fantastic actors and beautiful cinematography. Especially the anti-gravity scenes in the hotel are gorgeous. I’ve seen Inception several times and keep being amazed. Definitely one of my all-time favourite movies.	2
7343	Parasite	bullshit	1
7344	The A-Team	The characters were weak and the plot was very formulaic and reminiscent of the early 90s, if this movie hadnt been called A-Team, no amount of people would have gone to watch it.	0
7345	A.I. Artificial Intelligence	Amazing ending	2
7346	Thelma	If I could give this a 105 percent I would. Absolutely wonderful, and one of my recent favorite films	2
7347	Baraka	 I get lost in the imagery every time I watch it.  Very hypnotic and beautiful.	2
7348	These Amazing Shadows	Kept me engaged, however, I feel that it should have been longer.	0
7349	Mad Max: Fury Road	WITNESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BLOOD BAG WITNEEEEEEEEEEEES 	1
7350	Thor: Ragnarok	it could be epical but now it is cool and fun!	2
7351	Midnight in Paris	One of Allen's best later films, although you may have to be an English major to enjoy it.  Classic Allen, a bit goofy, a bit philosophical.  Nothing great, but not a waste of time either.	2
7352	The Farewell	nice versus between east culture and west	2
7353	Infernal Affairs	It's rare to find a remake that's better than the original, but THE DEPARTED blows this Hong Kong gang-flick out of the water in every way imaginable. Worth watching only to compare to Scorsese's adaptation.	2
7354	Toy Story	One of the first animated films I remember watching, during a phase where I'd watch movies over and over again ad nauseam. The Toy Story series holds a special place in my soul, Pixar's best series in my opinion. 	2
7355	My Blueberry Nights	stylisticly perfect yet slightly disappointing	2
7356	Let the Right One In	A vampire film unlike any other.  Heartfelt, disturbing and VERY well written.  My fantasy is for movie fans to skip Twilight and watch Let the Right One in.  This is the type of film that stays with you long after the credits start rolling.	2
7357	Pulp Fiction	I think my favourite thing about this was the dialogue. A fun story that somehow also makes you think. All-around very enjoyable.	2
7358	Winter's Bone	Beautifully acted and directed this film sucks you in in an instant and does not let go and has the ability to make the fact you are watching fiction dissolve. These were real people to me and that is what makes this so emotional as well as engrossing. One of the years best but then you already know that.	0
7359	The Big Lebowski	Probably the best film of 1998. A perfect metaphor for what a smart working class person goes through trying to make his way in a town full of the rich, ambitious, dumb, and insane.	2
7360	La La Land	The most artistic fun movie I've ever seen. It just couldn't be better	1
7361	Drive	most boring and overrated movie  I've ever seen.	0
7362	Shin Godzilla	The first Godzilla film in 12 years, and that's about the time I've waited for this one. I was happy to see it in Japan when it came out, and a childhood dream came true. It's the most terrifying, adult Godzilla until now, I couldn't have wished for more than that.	2
7363	A Dog's Purpose	For a cute movie about dogs there's a lot of dog death in here.	1
7364	Bronson	what does cult mean ? how should a cult movie be ? how do you do something that is totally unique and special ? answer to all those question ; Bronson.	2
7365	Cellular	Excellent Movie	2
7366	House of 1000 Corpses	crap. too bad.	0
7367	Pulp Fiction	Best movie ever	2
7368	The Wizard of Oz	I hate this film and will never understand why it's so beloved. 	0
7369	Another Life	Equal parts Scream and Beverly Hills, 90210. In fantasy space. With fantasy science. And a lotta real problems.	0
7370	Annihilation	It has Natalie Portman, but it's also wierd as fuck.	1
7371	Zack and Miri Make a Porno	Momentami smieszny, ale ogolnie bez sensu i dosc oblesny.	1
7372	Wind River	Warning: this is a **very** intense, violent movie that's extremely well done.  	2
7373	The Sound of Music	I grew up with this movie and it gets better every year. Love the music and story. It's such an uplifting movie and it brightens my day everytime I watch it. Love Julie Andrews!	2
7374	The Disaster Artist	not a comedy but pretty funny	2
7375	Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade	The second best entry in the Indiana Jones series, this one is great fun, but lacks any real sense of wonder and dread that the first film had. It still has a bit of Spielberg smarm, but the action sequences and chemistry between Connery and Ford make it a classic.	2
7376	Foodfight	fuck armageddon this is hell	0
7377	Napoleon Dynamite	I don't like being expected to laugh at how mind-numbingly dumb the characters are.	0
7378	Feud	1. Season	2
7379	Tsotsi	Pure sappy crap. It comes as no surprise that Academy voters would gobble this up and award it the Foreign Language Oscar.	0
7380	No Country for Old Men	One of the greatest adventure films of all time. The Coen's rare blend of adaptation and creativity make the McCarthy story jump to life on the screen. Probably one of the best performances by an entire cast in the last twenty years or so. Bardem's villian was simply a masterpiece. 	2
7381	Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children	Quite an enjoyable film with a great imaginary world and characters inside. see. Hail Eva Green!	2
7382	A Nightmare on Elm Street	Old movies good movies.	2
7383	Gerry	 I gave this a 2 simply because of the dirt pillow conversation.  Other than that it was the most boring movie I have ever seen, too bad they couldn't have made better use of really good camera work.	0
7384	The Silence of the Lambs	One of the best movies ever made. If you like thriller it is a must see movie.	2
7385	Watchmen	watchmen is the great science-fiction and social psychology movie, for last years its the effective one of a few films for me.	2
7386	Logan	Overlong, overly violent and overrated.	0
7387	Glory	Interesting topic (even for european) with comic-book characters that ruin the effort of drama.	2
7388	Water	A wonderful satire.	2
7389	The Matrix	I was amazed as I saw it the first time the spring of 1999... not sure if it would bring about the same effect 10 years later	1
7390	The Matrix	The best movie I saw in my entire life.	2
7391	The Mission	brillian music of Enio Morricone	1
7392	Martyrs	This was really good, but I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone.	2
7393	3 Extremes	very unusual, very weird, very interesting	2
7394	Ay Büyürken Uyuyamam	This unintentional comedy is a must-see, because it's so inexplicably bad.	0
7395	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	So much worse than the Gene Wilder version.	0
7396	Eastern Promises	Surprisingly great movie. I haven't seen any Cronenberg prior to this and I was really caught off guard by how well made it was. I always found my self deeply involved in every scene and felt really satisfied as the movie ended.	2
7397	The Big Lebowski	awesome. walters a da!!	2
7398	Twilight	The best romantic movie that includes action and horror as well.	2
7399	The Apartment	A perfect movie.  Genius.  	2
7400	Wonder Woman	Great setup for her intro to the Justice League movie.	2
7401	Catwoman	would have rated it with 0, but Halle Berry is just too sexy for 0.	2
7402	Daredevil	Terrible, in a word.	0
7403	City of God	The Young and the Damned (1950)   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042804/	0
7404	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	One of the best!  The heart of what makes movies scary.	2
7405	Terminator 2: Judgment Day	The best sequel ever made. 	2
7406	Vampire's Kiss	Possibly one of the greatest performances ever crafted by the insanely brilliant Nicolas Cage.	2
7407	Kin-Dza-Dza	Just another barely-there-commentary wrapped in a dull pseudo-scifi movie.	0
7408	Lost Highway	WwWwWwoOoOoOoOwWwWwW	1
7409	Kingdom of Heaven	95/100 for the Director's Cut, the original cut gets a 70/100 for me.	1
7410	Sahara	The book was better.	1
7411	Gece, melek ve bizim çocuklar	It is a film that goes to dark side of the biggest metropol of Turkey, İstanbul. It is so realistic, so hard and naturally so painful. Also important and emotional for me because of projecting early 90s which is my childhood.	2
7412	Once Upon a Time in America	The Best Movie	2
7413	Inglourious Basterds	Favorite movie of all time.	2
7414	Tropic Thunder	This score has been determined after multiple forced viewings.	1
7415	The Truman Show	One of my favorites	2
7416	The Hunger Games	Holy fuck is Hunger Games ever a bad movie. Halfway through I was skipping ahead in the hopes that it would become interesting on at least a visceral level. That never happened and all I was left with was a threadbare Battle Royal that actually managed to come off more campy. At least with Battle Royal it was commited to the B-list action gorefest, whereas Hunger Games doesnt even have a half baked identity by an hour in. Not only that but it ruined the girl from Winter's Bone for me	0
7417	20 Feet from Stardom	Sting appeared and the whole theater groaned.	1
7418	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	oh, wes anderson, why aren't we friends?	1
7419	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	My favorite film.  Suberb acting, dialogue, and pace.  A masterpiece.	2
7420	Trainspotting	"One of the best films of 1996.Danny Boyle at his best and what a cast!
 Some bizarre scenes,yet some funny ones too."	2
7421	Prisoners	Best in class.	2
7422	Crazy on the Outside	Apparently there was no writer...	0
7423	Into the Wild	shocking and heartful story. love it. amazing shots.	2
7424	Akira	Loved the film. Akira was my first anime film, and opened my eyes to an incredible genre of film.	2
7425	Before Sunrise	"one of the best ..
 conversations through the film are very real and romantic
 true love story"	2
7426	True Romance	MY FAVORITE MOVIE!	2
7427	The Matrix	Very interesting movie and quite groundbreaking in it's time. Although this is really a science-fiction movie, the fact that it takes place in a simulation of this time makes it like something else. The premise that the world is simulated makes for making typically impossible action-movie stunts more believable. The muted color and light you find all of the movie contributes to a interesting atmosphere.	0
7428	Alien	"1979......
a film that was just ahead of it's time, if you made it now it would be all cgi and blue screen effects all over the shop. Just simply has to be one of the top ten films of the last 50 years.
"	2
7429	Little Miss Sunshine	It's like a Wes Anderson movie. Disfunctional, but funny family. Love'em. Another great one is Birds of America.	2
7430	House of the Dead	Uwe Boll = automatic zero	0
7431	Electrocuting an Elephant	viral marketing was a young art at the time	1
7432	Se7en	One of the intensed thrillers iv seen.	1
7433	The China Syndrome	a solid thriller throughout, but the final scene is simply brilliant.	2
7434	The Blues Brothers	Look i know its supposed to be a classic, but this movie is way too long i only scored it as high as i did, because of a few scenes and the writing (which was stellar) the movie itself just seems to drag.	0
7435	The Bourne Identity	"Does not do justice to the book.

The last thing I want to see is Marie St. Joseph's with a different name and a different characterization. I am sure there must have been a better way of making the film.

That said, the film is fast and pacy, if you see it without reading the book first."	0
7436	The Sixth Sense	Master-piece from Shyamalan	2
7437	Last Vegas	This felt like Hangover:geriatric edition. Sad for the most part, embarrasing for the rest.	0
7438	Lost in Translation	One of my all time favorite movies. So beautiful and funny at the same time. Bill Murray was amazing.	2
7439	The Purge: Election Year	sure	1
7440	The Beguiled	Not as sexy as I thought it would be. Also, I can't believe queen Nicole didn't get his full attention. Unrealistic.	0
7441	Casino Royale	The  most realistic of all Bond movies, and possibly the most suitable actor for Bond EVER	2
7442	The Mummy	My all time favorite! Has everything- action, comedy, drama, tragedy. All hale the Mummy! Imhotep! Imhotep! Imhotep!	2
7443	Ashes of Time Redux	horse love	1
7444	The Incredibles	My second-favorite film from John Lasseter, after the unjustly ignored Iron Giant.	2
7445	Twilight	awesome;]] wonderful amazing incredible shocking;]]	2
7446	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World	Funny Geeky comedy.	2
7447	Perfume: The Story of a Murderer	A pointless movie with an unsympathetic main character and a ludicrous and sick plot.  The first part wasn't too bad tbf with good cinematography and Dustin Hoffman in a decent role but the idiocy soon overwhelmed everything and turned it to shit.	0
7448	Watchmen	If anybody likes see big blue penis' over a thousand times in a movie, this is your film!  Never read the comic but just a horrible movie with random scenes strung together into an anticlimatic ending. Where in the heck did that big purple horned dog come from in the end? 	0
7449	Pride & Prejudice	My favorite movie ever 	2
7450	Gerry	It's like a German Expressionist film, without the German, or the Expressionism. One of the most painful movie-going experiences of my life.  I recall leaning over to my friend during the extended driving scene at the beginning, whispering, Wouldn't it be awful if the whole movie were like this? And so it was. I dunno. Maybe if I'd been warned beforehand how it would be I might have appreciated it more, but with an Oscar-winning screenwriter participating, I expected something different. 	2
7451	Let the Right One In	Quite possibly one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, and greatly contributes to its overall dark mood. I'm very curious as to see what the North American version is going to be like, but I highly doubt it will be as good.	2
7452	Harold and Maude	When I first saw Harold and Maude, I fell in love with it. Quirky and brilliant!	2
7453	Xew Xew	Masterpiece 	2
7454	Bang, Bang, You're Dead	Good Foster performance but overall rather average film.	2
7455	Funny Games	a few directors can achieve this. shocking.. 	2
7456	Inception	"
 "	1
7457	Finding Nemo	P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney	1
7458	Lost in Translation	I thought this was supposed to be a comedy...but i never even could see when i was supposed to be laughing.. SOOO boring! hate scarlett johansen!	0
7459	Enemy at the Gates	Contrived sniper-porn, and an awkward love scene.	0
7460	The Last Winter	Strong atmosphere and a decent musical score weren't enough to save this movie from a story so astonishingly bad that only Al Gore could appreciate it.	0
7461	Drive	Openening sequence is great... its all downhill from there. The writing, especially the bad guys dialogue, is terrible. It sounds like a 14 year old trying to imagine what a bad guy sounds like. 	2
7462	Regression	"It would be good movie, but where is the first structure of script? We couldn't even meet characters in the beginning of movie; thus, it didn't work well, yet not bad.
"	2
7463	Band of Brothers	"One of the most poignant displays of courage and heroism ever portrayed on the small screen. Really really entertaining as well. Hanks takes the grit and drama of Saving Private Ryan and elaborates upon it in every way possible. Historically accurate and cinematically unparalleled. I would suggest watching one or two episodes at a time. You'll want time to digest each one...
"	2
7464	Toy Story	One of the best animated movies i've seen, ahead of its time.	2
7465	The Sword in the Stone	A childhood obsession. The movie I've seen every day, for years, unrelentlessly. The ÜberVHS. The curse of my family. The thing that made my world go round.	2
7466	Linda Linda Linda	This is a true crowd pleaser. The deadpan humor is great, direction and photography are top notch, and the music will be stuck in your head for weeks. It's not perfect: the acting from the young supporting cast is a little uneven, and the pacing of the first half hour is awkward. Still, this movie is easy to recommend and stands up well to multiple viewings.	1
7467	I Am Number Four	The acting was bad.  Plot line is boring.	0
7468	Good Night, and Good Luck	"This film is in so many ways a window not only into our past but a window of our current world. If only more people would see this and then look outside and see the fear mongering that Bush is doing as the same thing Mcarthy was doing back then.. 

This move also reminds .. Strike that. Brings to light what TRUE reporting used to be.. If only our media of today would pluck up the courage to be somewhat like Mr Edward R. Murrow might we be better off? 

Humbaly yours."	2
7469	The Lion King	all time favourite :)	1
7470	Beethoven	-	1
7471	Sharknado	Where was Aquaman?	1
7472	Inception	this is the best  Drama, Sci-fi, Suspense/Thriller, Mystery movie I think	2
7473	Drive	stylish drivel	1
7474	The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	film was perfect nevertheless it's slightly different than original novel. 	2
7475	Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, Sprocket Holes, Dirt Particles, Etc.	Well, it's certainly a descriptive title.  And the edge lettering pulses in a somewhat hypnotic way, but boy, I stopped watching after about 30 seconds, concluding that there were more important thins to do in life.	1
7476	Children of Men	astonishing	2
7477	Ace Ventura: Pet Detective	Trans	1
7478	The Mexican	I began to watch it but I stopped it	0
7479	Abduction	Someone can tell this boy to stop playin' in stupid films like Twilight and Abduction ! Wake up Taylor !	0
7480	District 9	unpopular players made this film great.	1
7481	Grizzly Man	Sorry, I have a dark sense of humor, and while I understand the grim reality of the ending, I can't help but find this one of the most unintentionally funny movies ever.	0
7482	Starry Eyes	God, how fucking stupid and pointless this movie was.	0
7483	The Hurt Locker	boring but excellent !	2
7484	Legion	Did somebody mistype this as horror/action? Because I'm pretty certain this was the funniest movie of 2010. Too many great lines to quote like Tyrese explaining the old woman climbinb on the ceiling with baby teeth. Classic. I give it a 1 for the talent it took the people who made this film to lie to someone enough to give them the chance to make this horrendous movie.	2
7485	Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	Would have gotten a higher score if it wasn't for Keira Knightly.	0
7486	The Birds	outstanding!	2
7487	Serenity	Unorthodox and amazing movie that introduced me to the greatest sci-fi tv series ever - Firefly (albeit a little late like most Firefly fans).	2
7488	Lawrence of Arabia	One of the very best films of all time.  Brilliant acting, directing and cinematography.  The genius combination of Peter O'Toole and David Lean can't be beat.  A must see film for everyone.	2
7489	The Air I Breathe	If you really wish Hollywood did better movies, than this movie is really it. 	0
7490	This Is the End	"Insufferable,forced and painfully unfunny .Haven't laughed once.
